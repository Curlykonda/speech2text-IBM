(02:43.33, 02:52.61) (spk 0): well thank you pay I'm I'm really looking forward to serving the moderator for what I have no doubt is going to be a really interesting and highly relevant discussions for today .
(02:53.58, 04:13.49) (spk 0): as you mentioned every paediatrician but also also as a parent Oscar social entrepreneur who's dedicated to helping all children five and today's rapidly changing and globally complex world it's been my experience that this topic the topic of how best to approach freezing children in a digital world is one that perhaps more than any other is a universal interest and importance to parents paediatricians educators and researchers alike then probably leaving a whole bunch of people on that list so when it comes to discussing children media use questions of interesting concern Spain from the more technical which media is okay for how long it what age and should we as parents be monitoring limiting our children's media use and it's so help all the way to broader questions of how media use the instant impact how development and how best to parents in the digital age fortunately children and screams as Brad together today is still a group of expert panellists to share some of their research and practical advice regarding media rules parental controls family the only media plans and much more so with that as a quick overview what I'm gonna do now is give each of our panellists a chance to briefly share some of their working inside and then we'll open things up and leave plenty of time for our experts to address your questions .
(04:14.3, 04:43.63) (spk ??): so first is that Adam planner a licenced clinical psychologist in this twentieth European that practise who's been a digital they had for over seventeen years that depends %HESITATION consult with parents as well as technology companies to balance the many benefits of the digital world with healthy child development and mental help in with that animal turned over to you thank you so much I really appreciate the opportunity to speak to you all go ahead in %HESITATION sure my screen .
(04:48.85, 04:49.25) (spk 1): right .
(04:50.06, 04:54.67) (spk 1): please the technology and the centres working I can't see anything but my screen responded .
(04:55.74, 05:8.65) (spk ??): you are all good excellent okay so let's let's jump in %HESITATION as the first one first expert to go today I'm trying to set the stage %HESITATION in touch on a few different things .
(05:9.46, 05:52.19) (spk 1): dad we all be discussing in more detail so obviously any discussion of rental controls I'm gonna start off with a discussion or %HESITATION moment of a parent right with that what is the point of parent it right we're raising a children were raising future adults %HESITATION and you know as you can see the fence in the background it takes a lot of care and guidance and support to raise our our future results its principal intro than any discussion %HESITATION again I'm a clinical psychologist so I work with families all day long any discussion around parental controls really you know I would want to shy away from it being a belt the control .
(05:53.26, 06:19.2) (spk 1): I'll touch on that in a second but really repressive controls should be setting up is a way of safeguarding in mental ring with the group with the aim of helping our children learn to self regulate themselves and that's a huge task %HESITATION you know for that will let me take a lifespan but that really is the goal of childhood adolescence into young adulthood to learn how to manage yourself .
(06:20.09, 06:47.02) (spk 1): your digital parenting pioneers first time ever in the history of humankind %HESITATION you know parents have been around for you know system beginning this gap between what I as a parent I grew up with in with how well my children are exposed to having to manage and navigate is is is overwhelming to settle these things very very different insurance of my reference point .
(06:47.89, 07:3.58) (spk 1): reference points are really important because she means learn by doing and having some sort of %HESITATION Haron or reference that we can go back to the refer back you quite literally gives us a guidance of how did then approach this next decision making .
(07:4.39, 07:19.83) (spk 1): there's a lot of decisions that need to be made %HESITATION when it comes to parenting specially in twenty twenty one to come possibly coming out of a pandemic rate so %HESITATION insurance of reference point we have a lot of references I have a lot of references I'm sure you all use well .
(07:20.64, 08:23.57) (spk 1): I to a physical barrier physical way of being proactive and in helping our children be safe and in teaching them from walls the fences %HESITATION wise you know is that is like as a large you know society law parental control it's certainly a control over society giving us some guidance on what to do you've got a green light you stop at a red light in everyone agrees to that in the keeps us all safe car seats have remember very well when my first child was born %HESITATION almost seventeen years ago %HESITATION you know I actually went to the police station to make sure the course it was in %HESITATION in in a secure way because I was nervous as a brand new parent or soon to be parents and so I would imagining that you all %HESITATION to sign on to this weapon are today have similar types of worries and concerns and in the intent of raising our kids as well as we can in this %HESITATION very overwhelming confusing time .
(08:24.56, 08:53.74) (spk 1): yep the system I'm gonna take your really is on the guard rail %HESITATION old all kids are going to test the limits that's part of the process of learning into child development to trial and error to see what works what doesn't work and if you put a device in a child's hand which pretty much everything we is doing %HESITATION quite early %HESITATION then they give children through their learning process is gonna will test limits humans learn by doing .
(08:54.55, 09:7.96) (spk 1): so this is a slide out of my typical workshop where I'm not going to cover all this today I think we will talk this through mostly but I I chose the slide %HESITATION not because of what's on the screen there public because if we take a .
(09:9.58, 09:13.65) (spk 1): anyway so if we take sorry if I take a step back .
(09:14.58, 09:34.17) (spk 1): what parental controls are is is really a text based true to help us parent in the digital world is technology helping with technology and when using the far for reasonable way it actually does it's a huge part of how repaired now I know when I will rely on it but it is a huge part of what we're doing .
(09:35.86, 09:46.63) (spk 1): you know encouraging our kids to monitor to to slow down to posit thing and to you know for us tomorrow in mental health they're learning .
(09:47.89, 09:57.25) (spk 1): president roles in encouragement in in maybe even force as I often say the parent child dialogue which helps to learning for both parents and children .
(09:58.46, 09:59.99) (spk 1): what I was saying earlier is that we .
- end of chunk 1-
(10:00.0, 10:48.67) (spk 0): the reason I chose this slide is I really want to take a step back briefly in kind of look at the the let's say the young mom holding the back of her head because it's so stressful trying to think this through and see if there are kids in what is the right answering what do we do which again probably brought you here today I think it's a very important %HESITATION lens to look at this discussion it's just one of many lenses up a distressed out worried parent specially independent Nick is very important here so ultimately sorry alternately what we're talking about we talk about parental control if you this lens as principal inside just like when I had that anxiety the anticipatory anxiety as I was becoming a parent to make sure my car seat was installed correctly .
(10:50.16, 11:7.41) (spk 0): exactly is a very healthy normal part of being a parent specially young parents and in this overwhelming world of all of these I known on certainty inside he goes up because that's what inside it does that's normal what is the antidote for inciting typically .
(11:8.22, 11:14.31) (spk 0): control right the end to do if you're feeling in control you feel less anxious just in general .
(11:15.84, 11:30.38) (spk 0): what happens often in large different examples of life not just parenting is that because we feel anxious we gets so invested in the control that it almost becomes an allusion of control where then other clinical .
(11:31.19, 11:58.44) (spk 0): issues might pop up of magical thinking and different rituals in order to feel in control and doing these things to feel more in control %HESITATION so it's something I just want to be aware of as we talk through the different types of parental controls because it will give you some level of control but don't lose sight of the fact that we're raising future adults it's not just about keeping them safe in like in a little bubble in order for them to grow up .
(11:59.25, 12:4.02) (spk 0): %HESITATION having clear rules and expectations will obviously be very very critical here .
(12:4.92, 12:5.65) (spk 0): so %HESITATION .
(12:6.89, 12:9.15) (spk 0): so so let's just jump into the sort of video .
(12:10.18, 12:12.98) (spk 1): the proved me because I might get .
(12:13.95, 12:25.5) (spk 1): he was trying to file the will the ones painted on the cable anything new is Chad curiosities bad dietary plan basically anything fun is the best .
(12:26.63, 12:44.09) (spk ??): welcome to my world so something there I hear there from my kids him from a kids all day long in my office that it's so much control that anything that is fun because a lot of fun on the internet seem ticked up recently it's a lot of fun but with some concerns .
(12:46.51, 12:50.63) (spk 1): thank you the storey about how are they're changed in an instant .
(12:52.47, 12:57.43) (spk 1): what we didn't know was that our world the best come to an end .
(12:58.24, 13:5.37) (spk ??): and there are no rules on our cables to prepare for that right so I often feel like this is from the cruise the first fruits .
(13:6.22, 13:21.47) (spk 0): I often feel like that as a parent at there's no rules written down we are pioneers as they've set in that non clinical healthy appropriate adaptive protective anxiety is what is driving again through this land is driving .
(13:22.28, 13:36.27) (spk 0): or parenting decisions it is really is exactly is a preps signal to keep us protected as part of the phone %HESITATION flight and it's really about survival again survival to raise future adults .
(13:37.2, 13:44.86) (spk 0): human brain typically doesn't fully developed until twenty five to thirty leave that in so over the lifespan .
(13:46.75, 13:52.89) (spk 0): the ability to control in think through things and have impulse control doesn't fully developed until much later .
(13:53.7, 14:14.25) (spk 0): don't panic even though there's no rules written down we are the pioneers %HESITATION or children %HESITATION or they're with us in the I know almost as much or more than we do again I go back to this reference points they are first generation digital citizens and they are different things that as parents we can encourage them to do .
(14:15.28, 14:50.72) (spk 0): into that briefly now in terms of screen time they could set their own %HESITATION apple emits it doesn't have to block them but it increases their awareness all the presidential should be focused on helping our children HIPAA laws in sync through what they're doing not be consumed by their own inside the of the uncertainty of what's good about to happen but to think it through in a calmer slower way which is almost imperceptible to being a teenager teenagers by definition or more impulsive because their brains that front part of the brain is not fully developed .
(14:51.92, 15:43.96) (spk 1): they've dopamine that secreted in the brain's pleasure centre when we get the rest of information and we look at the screens there centre of the brain is most activated when we're kids and we're teenagers so knowing that they are so pulled into these in a way that we can't even understand has made me not B. as in Greece at them but realises a lot more I need to do as in my parenting for these little electronic drug delivery devices another to create a put it but that's what you're saying absolutely I mean it's amazing that there's many studies that look at MRI scans of the brain of kids who play a lot of the against twenty hours or more video games a week and when they compare them to people who are addicted to say drugs or alcohol their brain scans are similar .
(15:44.77, 16:16.11) (spk ??): so something is really happy Nina physiological level it's not just psychological is both physiological and psychological so what to do with that against Tempest I'm wrapped up in the wall we'll talk about this in more detail during the Q. innate but I've so I'm always gonna recommend since I get asked about apple every single day using what is built in because you know I have to buy anything extra if you have if you're an apple family as many families are you go right to apple's website right there %HESITATION .
(16:17.09, 16:42.97) (spk 0): it's set up family sharing in the family sharing is key because it has been asked by system where it's it's forces the dialogue as the child catches download whatever he wants then heard about in the back of the bus so you can go through and stepped up again apple has changed their website recently where they walk if you would pretty quickly and easily %HESITATION in again it's set up in a way where I mean increases that dialoguing for ages the learning .
(16:44.8, 17:3.36) (spk ??): give you a family calendar and again that it has to buy system so the child is in just grabbing whatever apple toy that these seem plug in their credit card that is often always green time again they have a great website now %HESITATION where it kind of washes to really do that go there sorry .
(17:4.23, 17:20.48) (spk 0): and so this is what I was talking about before with the child can actually see how long they've been on what was the first app to be picked up when they when they picked up their phone many give that self awareness over time is going to help them learn in make better choices as the forward .
(17:22.91, 17:29.88) (spk 0): so you can see obviously because up to see where the family sharing the children are there in all of that is remote through your phone .
(17:30.69, 17:36.5) (spk ??): and all these great information and I'm sure it can be very helpful for people to have that very specific .
(17:37.69, 18:11.95) (spk ??): all you know I'm really struck by your comments that you you and I clearly think alike in this round I'm ideal life in the world of really bring in child development setting kids up to sixteen in this world the bill then you know you mentioned this idea of helping them learn self control but setting some guard rails and you know like you said it's it's their job to test when it and when I often say to that I'd need to parents and it's it's their job to test limits it's your job to set some and I think that's a perfect segue into our next speaker if you don't mind me absolutely great welcome back all this thank you yep perfect .
(18:12.76, 18:32.79) (spk 1): because again that's every insured K. so great you know you need to set some limits what should those limits B. and next up I'm excited to introduce international speaker Daschle is a bit smaller would ask who focuses on internet safety issues and we need to print all workshops writing digital parenting in coaches parents and dust packages in the digital age .
(18:33.66, 19:59.86) (spk 1): she's a consultant for the council of Europe unified and young phones as well as a contributor to internet matters UK safer internet and your family online safety institute and any other key actors in online child protection so the best I think you're gonna have plenty more that people are really really interested in here yes thank you so much Laura and I'm I'm conscious of time because I I'm going to just hold it to five minutes I'm not gonna use any slides because I just really want to talk to the parents like look at them hi I am just kind of explain I think that I hear quite a lot of parents ask me about one of the best point of control and I always enter in the same way you are you are the printer control with children under nine of course there are fabulous apps and devices and software in office of things that you can use to boost your parental guidance and like %HESITATION Adam was saying I would prefer to say print all guidance rather than print a control but I think that over the age of nine this can be more challenging I haven't printed controls on a device at unless you discussed this with your tween or teen in you've asked for their employed in you've crafted in family media agreement or a device agreement together so just keeping it really simple I always talk about how you can use it right so that's where miss communication engagement if it and by that I mean .
- end of chunk 2-
(20:00.0, 20:14.55) (spk 1): %HESITATION anytime that you're dealing with the issue online whether we're talking printed controls or social media or online gaming let's boost our awareness so with printed controls what are the different types %HESITATION and I'm just spoke about a .
(20:15.41, 20:55.87) (spk 1): port in screen time love that enjoyed the other have Google well being there are lots of lots of resources out there the taken there what do you want to stop where to do then we have this communication part right so you're going to be speaking with your child again under nine you can speak with them in a way that's age appropriate but again at this point as a lawyer I will tell you that you are there the digital guardian %HESITATION and so you know take it as your responsibility to put those guardrails on but we were talking about the older children you're still digital guardian but you can communicate with them you can let them know why certain things are inappropriate and you gonna be listening to them without judging .
(20:56.69, 21:51.91) (spk 1): %HESITATION lastly I would say this whole sort of engagement piece is that we are going to engage with our children are going to encourage them to share concerns objections in insurance the games that they're on something that I did with my own son who's eleven he wanted to have a chat opened up on in game and I said but I have printed control fungus so he said well money let's just look at it I said you're right let's take a peek and so we walk through it together and I found that there are ways for him to check with his friends but he knew %HESITATION and with to block and filtering it each time I would trouble something I would say do you need that and he would say no I don't need that and so he knew himself %HESITATION what he could do with what he needed so I think that we can really show our children the settings things that are gonna still too bad language or violent content or eliminate the chat in we really can't explain to them that they don't need all of these features but again I really want to .
(21:52.95, 22:25.19) (spk 1): stress this whole idea but prior to creating a a tech agreement Amelia green meant a smartphone agreement what ever again my Moyer had on don't think it's so much as a contract but been giving as near the digital parent I'm going to respect their toys or games and bay as your digital child appointed respect the walls limitations in your guidance and values so I'm just going to leave it at that more so that we can speed along and get to the audience because I can't wait to answer some questions .
(22:26.0, 22:56.52) (spk 1): %HESITATION and I think that I'm you get a lot of people who are gonna be eager to ask questions they don't you just sent and I love your idea I mean even I am somebody who doesn't like with words and I write and I do like communications side and the shift from side control to guidance I think fits with what I'm talking about with the guard rails and then you help facilitate with this goal how do you back up and like kids learn those skills right and I think that for everything pretty controlled social media really attacking tick tock or Snapchat or video games minecraft or forty nine what have you we can do it .
(22:57.93, 23:24.14) (spk 1): you know I I delight in the twenties although how do we develop them in this idea of engagement I mean obviously awareness in communications I've often told parents that we should be looked at as C. E. O.'s Arian chief engagement officer yeah it's one in the business world proved to be successful as well as when we %HESITATION C. E. O.'s in gauge as opposed to do the sort of dictatorial approach right I'm gonna go trademark that is that right now Laura .
(23:24.97, 23:25.8) (spk 1): on the something here .
(23:27.21, 24:08.8) (spk ??): you know I'm I'm really excited now to switch over to our next couple expert and let them win because the bills are in the the realm of human computer interactions and I think it's gonna be really interesting to have their input as well so now let's go to that Ricky Davis definitely Davis isn't so see a professor at the university of Washington information school where she is a founding member in cold rector of the UW digital usually I'm that good Davis's research exporting impact of digital erected and network technologies on young people's learning and development and key I think I'm as excited as everyone else to hear what you have to contribute to the conversation here great thank you Laura you know share my screen now .
(24:14.38, 24:40.56) (spk 0): okay hi everyone %HESITATION so my focus today is not so much about rental rules or parental controls limiting the amount of time kids then with technology but how parents can support their children's positive experiences with technology and perhaps reflect on what makes your own experiences with technology more or less positive chip but before we get to the positive tech experiences I do wanna take a minute .
(24:41.77, 24:50.38) (spk 0): to talk about what my research has to say about where screen time tensions come from especially in families with teenagers .
(24:51.29, 25:07.0) (spk 0): so first place it might be easy to assume that technology related tensions come from parents and change different perspectives and their different approaches to technology still parents sent to saying kids these days are so different well teen say parents are so out of touch .
(25:8.43, 25:13.77) (spk 0): but in fact my research suggests that parents in teams are actually far more similar than you might think .
(25:14.71, 25:43.75) (spk 0): so when we still go to group of parents and then separately with their change children about their own check you especially their phones both groups described experiences in remarkably similar ways so I'm gonna read to coach about interviews and I invite you to guess which one belongs to a parent and which one belongs to a teen and we're gonna do a Paul just see how good you are and so the first code is I'm on my phone waiting much like I'm judging right now to check it .
(25:44.56, 25:47.73) (spk 0): the second is but I've just been looking at my phone .
(25:49.86, 26:12.59) (spk 0): and sorry this surveys in front of the quote to me %HESITATION just to get my phone like I'm just looking at it because people are messaging me and I want to look at them so bad but I'm here and I'm trying to not do it so now we can show the survey and do you think the first quote with a parent or a teen do you think the second call was a parent or a chain .
(26:14.73, 26:17.0) (spk 0): or both family team both of my parents .
(26:35.65, 26:40.3) (spk 0): okay can we go ahead and close the policy see how well everyone did .
(26:45.43, 26:57.57) (spk 0): okay there's quite a split okay so it let me do the big reveal it looks like most people think the first one was a parent in the second one was a teen and .
(26:58.95, 27:7.44) (spk 0): if you could go ahead and close that but okay great so you are correct so the first one was a mother and the second one was a team .
(27:8.25, 27:8.53) (spk 0): %HESITATION .
(27:9.41, 27:25.43) (spk 0): but in addition to sounding extremely similar I also want to call your attention to the fact that this mother in chain or expressing pretty strong feelings about their phones so like wage like I'm judging right now to check it I want I want to look at them so bad .
(27:26.49, 27:33.09) (spk 0): it suggests that neither is really feeling particularly good or in control of their tech use welcome back back to this in a moment .
(27:34.44, 27:45.04) (spk 0): so parents in chains are also very similar in how they talk about each other's techie and again as I really next to call to want to a survey but I just invite you to guess which do you think it's taking .
(27:46.5, 27:57.56) (spk 0): I don't matter or change either so the first one is she literally just take her phone and sit like this imitating phone in front of her face he died or mother nice to see your head .
(27:58.46, 28:05.8) (spk 0): the second one I always joke with doctor mother children I'm like hi you're still beautiful I always see your forehead that's all I see .
(28:7.24, 28:26.22) (spk 0): so the first one is a team complaining about her mother and the second one is a mother using very similar language to describe her children's phone use so turns out this image of looking at a family member's head as they start their screen appeared often enough in our data that we gave it a name the forehead effect .
(28:27.1, 28:37.6) (spk 0): so in a nutshell both parents in change or I'm satisfied with their own check use generally speaking and they also feel that the other person's check uses more problematic than their own .
(28:38.77, 29:24.28) (spk 0): so this suggests that both parents in change have work to do to become more self aware and intentional about their own check use same time become more other aware and everything it recognising that they're likely to have different goals and purposes for using technology but these differences don't mean that one is more important or legitimate then the other this is where the empathy comes in trying to understand where the other person is coming from but the value and what they're trying to achieve through their technology is in this process of emphasising currents in chains are likely to find they have more in common that they might think so my last two minutes I just want to focus in on this piece about becoming more self aware and intentional about your technologies and also your teens technologies .
(29:25.94, 29:33.96) (spk 0): so in April of last year my students and I started a study examining the experiences of Seattle area and Jean strain the pandemic .
(29:34.98, 29:41.87) (spk 0): and through interviews and daily surveys with them we look at the connexion between their technology use and there will be .
(29:42.94, 29:59.99) (spk 0): in particular related how their daily well being fluctuated depending on how much total time they're spending with technology on any given day how much time they spend specifically with social media and also setting time aside completely how much satisfaction they got up from their checking the area Ince's .
- end of chunk 3-
(30:0.82, 30:29.39) (spk 0): so it turns out that how much time she spent with technology on Wednesday had absolutely no connexion to help good they felt the next day the same thing with for social media again it didn't matter how much time they spent I'm picking up or Instagram what mattered was how they had violated the time they spent with their favourite platforms so changed to read their time as technology as more satisfied more meaningful on Wednesday tended to report higher levels of one well being on the next .
(30:30.61, 30:40.75) (spk 0): so what exactly makes for a tech experience and that's more or less that is fine so in our research we found that the satisfying take experience does one or more .
(30:41.56, 30:59.04) (spk 0): the fondest things so it might allow teens to engage actively and intentionally in a pursuit that aligns with their overarching goals and values might provide opportunities for them to learn your skills in pursuing their interest or it might allow them to connect with others in a specially their friends .
(31:00.0, 31:11.06) (spk 0): so if you put everything together to over R. shingles I think all families should be striving for or once reduce tensions among family members when it comes to everyone's checked .
(31:11.87, 31:33.46) (spk 0): said help and she was increase both parents meaningful and satisfying technology experiences and their chains and meaningful satisfying technology experiences as well tensions can be reduced by parents in teams becoming more self aware and intentional intentional in their own check use and also more where Evan everything explored each other second .
(31:34.39, 31:57.03) (spk 0): when I come through increasing meaningful satisfying technology experiences and beyond a look out for experience is definitely one of these three qualities active intentionally gauge meant opportunity pursuit %HESITATION interest my new skills and also the ability to connect with others especially for teens their friends and I will stop there thank you .
(31:58.06, 32:46.86) (spk 0): thank you Katie really really call information and and again I think there's a lot of questions an interesting this idea tonight just amount amount of time as much as it would be nice to have instead she was a strict amount of time for age that we use but great to hear the research on this we're gonna take a little bit of a shift now and here from someone else before we get back into some more research we're gonna hear from Technische lane and tell Sonny is an Emmy nominated filmmaker founder of the Webby awards and after of the national bestselling book twenty four six giving up screens one day a week to get more time creativity and connexion %HESITATION winner of the Marshall McLuhan outstanding book award and with no more introduction needed I think you've got lots of people interested in that sort of your approach to I'll definitely something let you take it from here .
(32:47.93, 32:48.59) (spk 1): thank you .
(32:49.4, 32:54.78) (spk 1): and it's just been a pleasure to hear everybody's different perspectives were all passionate about the same issue .
(32:55.88, 33:9.06) (spk 1): and I can share with you that my background is in tack I founded the Webby awards my husband's a professor of robotics were very interested in technology and windows that amplifier lives in windows that MP tape or lives .
(33:9.87, 33:26.67) (spk 1): and about eleven years ago you know we were the first ones to get the iPhone back in two thousand and seven and I think we're one of the first crew to get very addicted to it and I didn't like the way I was feeling and I had this kind of very dramatic series of events and they really made me .
(33:27.48, 33:31.54) (spk 1): question house living a lost my dad and my daughter was born I second or so .
(33:32.35, 33:54.29) (spk 1): my family and I started doing something we're Jewish we are not religious but we're control Jews but there's a concept called should back which is three thousand years old and the concept is a day of rest and I'm really in America only orthodox Jews will take a complete their arrest and was most cultural Jews maybe they'll do a show by dinner couple times a month or something .
(33:55.25, 34:4.96) (spk 1): but my family and I decided to actually we call or text about so for eleven years now I'm from Friday night to Saturday night all screens go up in the house .
(34:5.77, 34:44.13) (spk ??): and it is literally the best thing is appearing %HESITATION with my husband and %HESITATION you know we always have people over on Friday night and during the pandemic at a distance but a Friday first social even our friends kids I mean our doctors are almost eighteen twelve so it's a very social night we often will invite their friends families over if they want to be social but it's for family and friends and there's no screens and it's literally my favourite conversation of the week because we we let people know people now that we got in screens and I'm gonna come over so there's no one looking at their screening you know cell phones like you on one person bring that out then everyone brings the loud and then are you having for heads right so %HESITATION .
(34:45.21, 34:51.32) (spk 1): we travel trains you know Friday night and Saturday is very analysed and .
(34:52.13, 34:59.35) (spk 1): we do all these things that bring us joy they done about screens cooking napping reading the great need sure .
(35:0.99, 35:2.51) (spk 1): and usually %HESITATION .
(35:3.35, 35:8.85) (spk 1): I mean it's it's wife I mean as a filmmaker is I feel the most creative I think it's really tired kids .
(35:9.66, 35:15.54) (spk 1): %HESITATION how to live without a screen like they can walk outside without one and be really resourceful and enjoy it .
(35:16.63, 35:49.66) (spk 1): then it has a ripple effect the other sixteens but I'm gonna say that I find the other sixteen harder %HESITATION I think the whole concept of out of sight out of mine is much easier when we have this very clear boundaries so for us as a family it's been really great but just just you know parenting is on modelling behaviour and we all do this thing together which is that we transfer into Monday week and ended up reading a book about it which really called twenty four sixty twenty walks people through how to bring this in your life in a lot of neuroscience I make a lot of films about no signs .
(35:50.7, 36:05.2) (spk 1): and the why you should do it and course for different age kids there's going to be a different conversation and a lot of a lot of women who like I want to do this we have to get my husband is doing like having read the book maybe is going to respond to the science more but you know the kids %HESITATION .
(36:6.01, 36:10.82) (spk 1): I think the other sixteenth I also talk about little many interventions that I do .
(36:11.63, 36:27.75) (spk 1): %HESITATION in our kids do you know we have no screens in the bedroom nine PM they go downstairs because there's so much research on how much kids are checking in on that so I'm very gan I feel like as a interesting to work control or guidance which I really love that reframing .
(36:29.3, 36:42.26) (spk 1): but for us it's like we hope you know all the stars about to go to college and she wants to bring us practise with her in college and she says it's really protected her from high school burn out just because she can't do homework on Saturdays we not letter .
(36:43.07, 37:25.31) (spk 1): because we really believe in there so much research that I true Dave rash is gonna recharge you in even a rest from the social drama and social media and I feel in a mental rest from the pandemic museum election is and I just feel sorry charge so it's kind of showing them that this is this insurance with %HESITATION like yoga meditation but this is kind of a middle road that we're kind of doing a non religious way that anyone can do and it's it can be life changing and I just didn't about last week I had all these teams on who's doing something warm I'm fighting I'm helpful found it's been for them so I'd love to close with a two minutes on the phone maker that I've made on the subject called dear student .
(37:40.52, 37:41.81) (spk 1): I'm not hearing sound .
(37:45.63, 37:51.45) (spk ??): others hearing sound and gnashing Sunday okay wait one second while they really share that with the sound button .
(37:53.6, 38:1.53) (spk 1): and while they're doing that I can just say that there's a big movement of a lot of teams that are starting this okay start from the beginning pull that slide over thank you .
(38:30.63, 38:31.13) (spk 0): %HESITATION .
- end of chunk 4-
(40:9.23, 40:9.86) (spk 1): so .
(40:11.69, 42:11.02) (spk ??): I did want to say but I have had some books been out there's a lot of people in covering this practise but I think in the last since the pandemic so many teams in college since arriving to me wanting a change because I think everyone depending just xcelerated this screen overdose and such an extreme way for everyone so I'm feeling very hopeful that perhaps one of the benefits from the pandemic with it took it to such an extreme right even the kids are the teams in the next generation I want to rebalance right definitely I think you've really catching something in that I can get the pandemic really brought this to the forefront of different anyone who wasn't spending time thinking about it before please put me on now what I also love about what you've done is this next between research and practical paying double what do you do about it and again I appreciate you letting me interjected between the researchers there because again it's still going to have to research what do we know where we figuring out N. B. what do we do with that how do we come up with something that in some way simple but having just since we kids off to college in the last four years it's not it's really simple into you do a nine month affected you said it's actually harbouring the other six days but that one day really is is sort of the Dave getting joining definitely been my experience as a parent as well you know I think it's in there is so much for your search on out of sight out of mind that if you're trying to go on a diet don't have cooking therapy anyway if they don't have the temptation around every second in that that's the way they feel like I'm the best parent where I'm not wrestling like we all do the other days if I could just because of the night it's not part of the negotiations for the day the irony to see you know ideal Latin world really childhood is the same thing holds true for two year old I received my thank you candles yes yes you need to do before I let you go you get some questions off to you as well and then I come back to this kind of idea but the research to find out this is many shipped finally but not last but not least to doctor pen with miss .
(42:11.02, 42:32.59) (spk ??): E. system professor in the department of computer science and the director of the socio technical interaction research S. T. A. R. I am her expertise in human computer interaction research helped her peace students to understand the value centred design WHN so before we get to questions pains you are up and we're looking for anything would you have to share .
(42:38.8, 42:44.12) (spk 2): I'll end it myself that's the typical staying of the pandemic on's in these days .
(42:44.93, 42:47.12) (spk 2): I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen .
(42:47.93, 42:54.49) (spk 2): so what I'm going to talk about today is to address %HESITATION however the questions that we got from parents like .
(42:55.3, 43:24.26) (spk 2): what is the best friend of the troll apps for me to use and unfortunately I'm not gonna give you assistance entering that instead I'm going to change the conversation a little bit to talk about a teen centred perspective of parental control apps and online safety because in the field of human computer interaction we like to focus on the users and in this case instead of treating users as parents when it comes to the online safety of our use my lab what we do is like to focus on cheap .
(43:26.21, 43:53.73) (spk 2): so obviously as a parent it makes sense that we're scared if you look in the news headlines our teams are at the injury all of the time and it makes us has this sense of fear just like Adam was talking about about the English diary so what happens when we have fear we want you get control we want to solve the problem we want to seal their teens in protecting because their futures at stake SO we become protectionist .
(43:55.51, 44:14.06) (spk 2): so that makes sense well we might ask the question of what parental control apps are best for keeping my pain safe online according to pew research about sixteen percent of parents use parental control absent that increasing over time so one of the things that we did in our plan is that we analysed seventy five at that were available on Google play .
(44:14.87, 44:39.46) (spk 2): for the purpose of adolescent online safety risks in here some of the findings from that study one of the important things when you think about design and the affordances of technologies argument dice so there's a concept called are you sensitive design well we have to be intentional about our use of technologies because each technology that we use has certain values in that is within it .
(44:40.27, 44:41.27) (spk 2): in this case .
(44:43.22, 44:48.14) (spk 2): well we found is really ultimately why these apps are often called parental controls .
(44:48.95, 45:28.27) (spk 2): we created a framework I've seen on the TV strategies that balances between parental control and team self regulation so common ways that parents can monitor change in their digital media your system monitoring restriction at the mediation or talking or giving instruction about technology is that education but the amount with ways that we can do this as Adam suggested is really the ultimate weight move is towards helping to self regulate their online behaviours through self monitoring managing their impulse control coping with risks and also education what we found when analysing these apps is there really headed three headed .
(45:29.25, 45:33.96) (spk 2): towards the authoritarian style of parenting through monitoring restriction .
(45:34.77, 45:57.78) (spk 2): so this is where you as a parent might wanna ask yourself do I consider myself an authoritarian parents or do I consider myself a parent that wants to give implement a tiny and privacy and other family values and so does take away from this is to have intentional technology is that when you're just using technology but also when you're using .
(45:59.1, 46:1.45) (spk 2): technology to monitor technology yes .
(46:2.69, 46:13.13) (spk 2): what we also found is that many of these features were very privacy invasive so the level of giving parents the exact conversations that team was having with other people including their friends family in France .
(46:14.89, 46:23.99) (spk 2): and hello all nothing restrictions with no ability for change to negotiate the one feature provided for teams with an S. O. S. feature to get help from a dot .
(46:24.8, 46:25.97) (spk 2): so what are we telling team .
(46:26.78, 46:27.87) (spk 2): we trust them .
(46:28.68, 46:32.27) (spk 2): that we think that there are quick to handle these decisions on their own .
(46:33.08, 46:37.44) (spk ??): or they they need to come tomorrow and dad to get help winning Canaris online .
(46:39.5, 46:50.14) (spk 2): so also merry what we're doing is we're sending clean some mixed messages and this is what I hear from you all the time well we wanted to care about their privacy but it's sametime we're taking all of their privacy away .
(46:50.95, 46:56.53) (spk ??): we want them to earn our trust but we're not giving them the opportunity to do so .
(46:58.08, 47:3.54) (spk 2): so this fear based approach to parenting equates to an absolute only approach to online safety .
(47:4.61, 47:8.49) (spk 2): in what we know about absolute only approaches to other types of rescue .
(47:09.4, 47:10.45) (spk 2): they don't often work .
(47:11.26, 47:24.99) (spk 2): we also want to quit all risk exposure to harm because changed me to be exposed to someone recently can I had a couple of them and be empowered to deal with these respond their own so they can become productive members of society as the agent dot .
(47:26.94, 47:38.29) (spk 2): so the most interesting thing that our research is once we hear from pains about these parental control apps we analysed seven hundred and thirty six reviews that were posted on Google play by teen .
(47:39.1, 47:59.59) (spk ??): we found that many of these apps for overly restrictive know preventing them from doing the typical things that we don't want him to do like watching pornography but not allowing them to do simple things like their homework their privacy invasive where number of teams equated their parents just stock ours because they use these apps .
(48:00.4, 48:06.9) (spk ??): and most concerning is that many of these apps seem to harm the parent relationship of trust with the team .
(48:7.72, 48:13.47) (spk 2): %HESITATION wear jeans equated this use of parental control apps to breezy parenting .
(48:14.29, 48:15.88) (spk ??): one No shoes just happening .
(48:17.1, 48:28.76) (spk 2): there were some positive beneficial characteristics mentioned by teams from specially those who felt like they really did need to get their technology use or the mobile app use under control similar to what Katie said .
(48:30.08, 48:40.34) (spk 2): and especially those who wanted to buy into the technology themselves the most positive ratings for the ones from chains where they were the ones who decided to instal the technologies on their own devices .
(48:41.28, 48:46.45) (spk 2): so when I can say entrances guidelines for choosing the right print control app .
(48:48.45, 49:10.28) (spk 2): it's make sure that the app's not overly restrictive check out the different features and the values in that is in those features make sure they'll be able to consider your change privacy you don't need to be part of every conversation we have online as much as you need to know who they're talking to make sure that they absolutely open communication and trust between parent and teen instead of changing your relationship to add more tension .
(49:11.24, 49:15.02) (spk 2): in eighteenth part of the decision if you have they're buying their .
(49:15.91, 49:39.33) (spk 2): be more apt to use the app in ekta bye bye it seems these days if they don't like to print a control that you're putting on their phone they go out and buy a burner phone anyway and finally don't be fought no parental control app is going to be a magic bullet you still have to do all of these other parenting strategies that all of these great expressive telling you to have open communication and the dialogue with your team .
(49:40.44, 49:41.49) (spk 2): so what else can we do .
(49:42.3, 49:59.99) (spk 2): well I think that we should treat only fifty years ago felt my whole process so when children are young that's when you use proper control similar to putting training wheels on a bike but then change programme until like thirteen to fifteen year old we need to focus more and teaching them exit strategies and coping skills .
- end of chunk 5-
(50:1.38, 50:3.87) (spk 0): what do you do if somebody ask you for any good picture .
(50:5.07, 50:30.35) (spk 0): and then finally by the time our teams are ages sixteen and seventeen we really need to release some of that parental control and give our use support as they mature into adults and let him know that you're there to help and withholding judgement very important well a little bit I said finally it's important feature teams to be good digital citizens online because I mine safety is a skill that's wired .
(50:31.36, 50:46.79) (spk 0): we shouldn't just give our teams trust would you give your sixteen year old keys of your car without teaching them how to drive no that's what we're doing with young children the ages of three and five by giving them a tablet without any kind of Scrooge control on it .
(50:48.5, 51:8.98) (spk 0): and then we need to listen and support our teams are using technology to mediate important life decisions sections their sexual relationships with their first boyfriend or girlfriend %HESITATION so we need to make time nineteen fifty apart everyday discussion of developing social emotional skills their mental health sex education .
(51:9.79, 51:14.7) (spk 0): and we want to make sure that teens feel comfortable sharing these experiences with that .
(51:15.51, 51:24.21) (spk 0): and finally we shouldn't treat online risk as more demand than typical restraint in Canada off line just because of our analysis year .
(51:25.85, 51:26.72) (spk 0): hi thank you .
(51:28.25, 52:33.63) (spk ??): Hey that was great and I have to say you know that your you touched on this idea of risk and one of the things I've done focusing on the early bring in child development room and connecting it to twenty percent we still needed throughout life one of the things I point out is that as parents we tend to try to minimise risk for our kids and I played up the irony I actually called to be able to do intelligent risk taking an idea called while skills greatly well but they don't fall down yeah can you later if I don't but not massive failure in you know when I typed in there since is it technically discussion silicon valley's unofficial marrow is fail early fail often field forward and I always have to qualify that by saying that does not mean don't use car seats it does that mean right perfect but down the middle of the highway without a break on the dance by your contact her bring with with %HESITATION jeans and letting them learn and it may be making little bit of you know some adjustments as they go along because otherwise they won't be able to deal against give back to the very rapidly changing world we know they're gonna get exposed to it so thank you very much for that presentation .
(52:34.72, 52:39.05) (spk 1): true to our work we actually left a good bit of time here for questions and answers .
(52:40.01, 53:9.27) (spk 1): what I think we're going to do we've got a mix of questions coming you know and P. M. don't go anywhere but everybody else get ready to jump in here is we have some people who want to ask questions like we're gonna change it down and then I'm also getting some submitted that I will read but let's first check over and we're gonna go start with Caroline who's joining us today and have a question about her ten year old so surely going to Sundance feel free and ask your question and then I'll pass it to one or more of the experts depending on the questions .
(53:10.27, 53:11.72) (spk 1): okay can you hear me .
(53:14.91, 53:16.07) (spk 1): okay I need to .
(53:17.65, 53:22.94) (spk 1): my daughter was inquire to prices home with the crime scene on .
(53:25.57, 53:28.42) (spk 1): I try to remember exactly what I had worriedly .
(53:29.77, 53:30.9) (spk 1): but I'm in next .
(53:32.0, 53:34.21) (spk 1): my rising again one my phone rings .
(53:35.16, 53:39.65) (spk 1): when I called her and if there's just a big mess I can get around it .
(53:40.73, 53:43.56) (spk 1): and that's what it is these these children have so many .
(53:44.59, 53:49.75) (spk 1): between like what happened is you know different storeys that they use in it's just .
(53:50.92, 53:53.18) (spk 1): it's I can't I don't know .
(53:56.26, 53:58.13) (spk 0): you know two weeks eight .
(53:59.06, 54:0.64) (spk 1): but my phone stops working .
(54:1.58, 54:3.75) (spk 1): and she said she doesn't know she doesn't know .
(54:4.56, 54:6.36) (spk ??): I really don't believe it but I could .
(54:7.96, 54:33.58) (spk ??): so I don't even know what my husband does nothing you know jumping anything I get the essence of what you're asking for a team sort of what you'd submitted this idea of what do you do when your ten year old %HESITATION when your child can you get around it transaction fraud and would you do something to track a package PM since late last night and then maybe Adam you can have some quick fast afterwards if you'd give a straight to you in a moment landed next questions I think you very much Carolina appreciate the questions .
(54:35.24, 55:4.03) (spk 0): hi Kelly that what I loved about your question with that how can I keep up and the injury giving you is hopefully going to be a relief to you you can't there's no way you're going to keep up with the latest technology it's like trying to put a governor on your car but then there's always gonna be something other feature added that's going to add another level of risk so the way that I suggested parents to deal with this is instead of trying to stay one step ahead of your team .
(55:04.9, 55:5.68) (spk 0): instead .
(55:6.69, 55:16.93) (spk 0): have your team teaching %HESITATION so sit with your ten year old daughter and complimentary on her tech savvy ness and say Hey you know you should think about getting a degree in computer science .
(55:18.12, 55:36.25) (spk 0): in in promote that your curiosity and say could you show me how to work in how you manage your privacy settings and asking questions about it as you go because in a sense what you're doing is giving her a level of the agency and and pride in knowing .
(55:38.97, 55:45.92) (spk 0): if you choose something anything doing any more open to you as well and so maybe you don't have to feel that for T. mobile is feeling like you have to stay ahead .
(55:47.51, 57:40.61) (spk 1): grading Adam do you have some time to check on that one as well yeah I didn't read the whole question but %HESITATION I would certainly agree with everything paying just said %HESITATION you know anything a little bit mentioned something earlier about you know there is no app really for this it's really the dialogue the parent child dialogue and %HESITATION having the tenure even a ten year old savage annual take work with him every day %HESITATION you know cannot just teach you but you know even if they are gonna be holding some back because they're afraid you're gonna then take things away whatever but it's just a short series of conversations that you could have %HESITATION as as again was a bit mentioned earlier you know %HESITATION having these conversations to %HESITATION help the child know that the Ken insured really compu when they are having difficulties or they have questions like like any other parenting decision or landscape this is just more complicated and we've all said several times because we are additional parenting pioneers and we don't have a reference point here and as again Pam just said we're not going to keep up it's about you know following along and being the parents trying to respond as best weekend I'm ready to push a little bit on that because I know that there's just this one question about okay so you've got a ten year olds or whatever age child and they're sort of testing your limits right and then when you when you do have those conversations it's not just a matter of all pretext everybody thinks I don't know like I don't know how that happened when my parenting strategy around the text what would you say to that and then we'll jump in I'm gonna give the other payments so we'll head up we're gonna go into an interesting question about related specifically to know diversity and how it relates to sort items items on an end out each year thanks but it Adam first if you want to address the okay well I'm not I don't know so I see this is a joke I try to be the same time not the most sink so .
(57:42.01, 58:24.2) (spk 1): basically when I would go back to is a setting up some sort of system where the child's access is contingent not in a really formal really straight away but is continuing if then when then on what they're able to demonstrate what what is the behaviour that they're showing not just what they set those kids are really good at saying the right thing I do that later can I do this if I get you know when you do this then you get that in polling the access back as a motivator for them to either be more honest or it's okay to take a break whether it should buy or not it's it's good it's good to take a break and then reset .
(58:25.01, 59:16.4) (spk ??): really well see you for that and like I said we're gonna make a bit of a shift here to a topic also consequence retirement Lee I am fact invites and some research is going on related to kids who are on the autism spectrum disorder or happy H. D. and their you know in other forms of moral diversity in their technology use and what what would you say to variations on that so if anybody wants to jump in this an extra up I. C. P. M. first to take off a museum in a package with him but if someone else wants to chime in outrage your feet P. M. sure yeah I mean this public is actually very near and dear to my heart my husband is a high functioning autism on the spectrum and we're we're in the process of getting our our data value waited and I've done some initial research with social media use of people on the autism spectrum and some of the things that I can say .
(59:17.21, 59:17.47) (spk 0): are they .

(60:3.97, 60:42.08) (spk 2): I'll just have to be honest with you however fears so much easier than having intimate relationship with the nother human being and so sometimes it might take the place of that and so while some exploration into pornography and sexual exploration for fourteenth older teens is appropriate having these discussions early on and with our children who are on the spectrum to let him know that Hey you know you need to understand that what you see in personality is it why is typical in any in a normal and healthy relationship between two people and then also .

(60:58.05, 61:29.96) (spk 2): we look at the moderator to have to be told on your so I seen thank you very much for that entering and it's nice because we're getting a lot of questions you know I'm trying to kind of put several to gather but really honing in on some very specific aspects and clearly people want to know what to do with all this great information I'm gonna let whoever wants to jump in on this one address the idea how to monitor gaming specifically the issue of gaming in which you do or not do in regards to our monitoring that do we have any takers on that one .
(61:31.05, 61:35.71) (spk ??): yea I just read my hand great only the best thing yep so .
(61:36.99, 61:37.77) (spk 1): play with them .
(61:38.85, 62:42.45) (spk 1): play with them that's the first informers just because but not because I'm ringing minecraft sure %HESITATION and because of the Nintendo switch behind me but Hey with them so that way you can see and understand what they're doing in you can intervene so for example I was playing my Chris %HESITATION my past with my child actually blocking on you to the nearest minecraft video %HESITATION and their work street names that we have we're racist and so I was able to use this as a teaching moment and just say okay this is what happens to what do we do there are things that happen on roadblocks in fortnight I mean there is no game so please parents there's nothing that's safe rate but the best thing you can do is play with them so that you can show them you know how to respond if someone has a snarky comment what to do in mind perhaps somebody destroys your world empathy kindness resilience I mean a week receive these things on the time and we can show them and we we don't have to be the best I mean I'm horrible at minecraft horrible but I do play so I would say to play with them okay panel I thought they were gonna play .
(62:43.79, 62:51.3) (spk 2): you know I have to say I'll tell you I have a little bit of an addictive personality myself and never really get into this new ages of gaming .
(62:52.11, 63:30.92) (spk 2): but nothing shocked my now twenty three year old son more than you think okay show me the game and finally is healthy now yea I don't think you're going to like this one right and games whether it's gaming or watching things but that idea of sitting down knowing what you're talking about even for you know my three kids my my middle on my twenty three year old is the one who he would seek you didn't hear he really cares what I think right sort of that company of what do I think is good they had you know sort of moral compass and so when you said you know I I don't think you want to see this one and he knows I just seen him reduces use based on that alone so I love that idea .
(63:31.73, 65:6.61) (spk ??): same with big and I'm glad you mentioned just a you're you're our values because it it it's culturally religious everyone we can all do this I did some work for the ministry of communications in Qatar nine %HESITATION they don't know it's like making engine in yet I would be able to look at their pillars and online it again it's the same thing we're all looking in talking about the same thing as to be was saying you know it's Adam specifically called it should be out or not it really is it is this week all put our own values and expectations and how we use technology and you know trying to appoint from paying a plane from up all the panellists what does also bring size you can pick any specific aspect and it relates to parenting in how we approach parenting in general applied this topic seems about the rules about gaming just like you know when does the child have to be home at night depending on their age can be set some time limit or if there's chores that need to be done there can be those sort of beautiful things well %HESITATION you know if you want to jump in on that one before I move ahead and I don't know just invited really quick just you know everything that was just said which was awesome understanding the game also helps you parent the child playing the game and really brief example like for tonight if you you know you don't understand that the game but we still regional %HESITATION battle royale version of fortnight some of the parents out there nodding it's it's out of a hundred people so I'm understanding the game play is going to help you set more appropriate limits around the game itself I can go on but I'll leave it at that .
(65:8.18, 65:45.94) (spk ??): so interesting question that was raising tipping a pink I'm gonna trust this one to you what's the best process for transitioning kids you over consume media to Littleton zero during the week is there is is you have a secret for success in that transition is it ripping the I need often there you go how how would you suggest to project that yeah I think it's a light in the positioning and you know it's a lot about framing it as what brings you joy without streams and said of I'm taking away at the screen and everyone in your family has a different definition of what brings them joy that foods .
(65:47.01, 65:52.08) (spk 1): you know shop being %HESITATION reading playing music but everyone's got a different .
(65:53.0, 67:6.77) (spk 1): answer to that so what I would suggest my resume going to details with this in the book is framing it as well you wish we didn't work out what would be fun to do together and then fill the screen free day with that because then it becomes your favourite it's not a punishment but you get back and it's reminding everyone in your family including my parents and I say this because I've gotten so much bag J. S. and long walks without a phone and being present I mean I just feel like it's about rediscovering analysed analysed pleasures and everyone knows with those pleasures are you have to unfortunately these days every analysed pleasure is interrupted by attacks or notification and then you're off the thing so what is it like to be president and in doing I mean I'll go bigger picture because I don't want to live in a society that has no room for reflection or presence in the world we've created I don't wanna live in a twenty four seven world I don't want to live in a world where I'm always reacting to everyone else and this one day a week I'm not in this perpetual state of reaction to attacks to notification to the news to a phone call to the new whatever it is it's exhausting and I think after this year specially .
(67:7.58, 67:21.69) (spk 1): I think you have to have Krige to carve out a space and say I I know this is a present we value this as a family mentally you're eighteen years old we actually make the rules and I want to tell you this as a society .
(67:22.56, 67:31.56) (spk 1): one of those society they balance in words thinking and nothing came all the power in the university's raised here because that's what we've created is that .
(67:32.4, 68:32.26) (spk ??): my kids to be able to think on their own tonight not in reaction to everyone else is that and that's a really every great wisdom practise types about the value of silence the value of thinking for yourself in the value of presence and you know taking a love that I think a lot of people are telling now their heads now more than ever you know now that we've been through European down like this idea of mindfulness and self reflection in whatever form it is really being over there tell you those connexions what you also said you also brought me back to work Katie had been talking about shipping this from all just the negative two what's the matter what brings you joy whether it's using technology or not using technology what brings you joy doing it %HESITATION any type of question again and to Katie now they just involved your name can you can you share how we can support change use of media and social connecting while also setting healthy boundaries to the point of making a sort of a positive experience sure yeah no I mean I think but %HESITATION went a little bit %HESITATION .
(68:33.07, 68:46.53) (spk 2): and Tiffany actually all the panels have been saying about the importance of you know invite becoming involved yourself in what your kids are doing no matter what age so my son is four years old and .
(68:47.86, 69:17.13) (spk 2): so one room bobbed in apps like peppers paint box and pop a troll games and things like that a little bit different %HESITATION but still I find that it's much easier for me when I don't this is not me playing with him all the time but if I do spend a little bit of time really understanding the games or whatever he's doing then I get a better sense of the natural rhythm of that game or whatever application he's using and and what's a national starting point I also .
(69:17.94, 69:46.91) (spk 2): to better support he's getting out of it in house he is an individual is intractable with that particular piece of technology and I think that's really important also for parents to keep in mind is each child yes there are particular developmental stage but they all have their own quirks in their own preferences and and and for some spending thirty minutes online it's going to be very different for another child %HESITATION and so it's just really important I think it's June in .
(69:48.26, 69:59.99) (spk 2): it's much to children when you're actually participating online side and again looking out for you know when they're a little bit older are they really actively engaging or is it more of a passive experience .
- end of chunk 7-
(70:00.0, 70:47.09) (spk 0): she really wanted to have something that's more active are they learning skills are they going deeper into their interest one thing that we found with our research on changing the pandemic is that the change to already had interest video editing music and things like that they were using technology in ways that really felt meaningful where's the teens who generally have interest or their interest for cut off because they make %HESITATION they were kind of floundering and getting sucked into the YouTube vortex of just clicking on the next recommended video into that's really challenging I think actually I heard from them that they they wanted some support in getting back on track and and finding and connecting to meaning for technology experiences and .
(70:48.26, 70:49.73) (spk 0): times like now G. as well .
(70:53.28, 70:58.62) (spk 0): I think you made it again like what a big warning sign across my screen it just took me a minute to .
(71:01.3, 71:23.66) (spk 0): and then a precious little bit further on this idea because again you know we've got a lot of people focusing annual teens and tweens and things but we'll be back to that really %HESITATION age range in Europe you touched on it in your email sure what specific to what we've all been through we've got a question anyone else can speak to this as well %HESITATION like but you need the question is so then wondering if someone can speak about strategies for helping to support guide .
(71:24.47, 72:14.65) (spk 0): forty seven year old age range if specially in the context that these kids have been given I can buy the public schools this year mate so that now you bad twenty yes I know you already check in yes no I I'm so right now I'm in Berlin Germany and I'm very grateful that my my sons %HESITATION you tell which is similar to day care they are absolutely no technology at all so I don't have to worry about that but you said you know there are many they've been many days where we haven't been able to access daycare %HESITATION and you know it's it's really I think it's similar to how you parent without technology you it's it's the same sort of approach you have to set clear limits and then enforcing consistently and I started off as an elementary school teacher and it's the same thing .
(72:15.6, 72:47.52) (spk 0): wonderfully functioning com classroom is one where the teacher has set up very clear limits from the beginning and you just even when it's not convenience or when you're tired you still enforcing consistently and I find myself as a parent when I when I'm tired I said okay go ahead watch one more episode of public troll I pay for it later because then I'm like I'm not being consistent and as much as my son might enjoy watching one more episode of public troll and just .
(72:48.33, 72:57.56) (spk 0): I said I can enjoy more having clear guidance and knowing that their structure round him and then I'm supposed to be providing great nice features you need you want .
(72:59.02, 74:16.1) (spk 1): I mean this is the thing I heard at the beginning of parenting but I think about it so much now that my daughters are almost eighteen and twelve but you know you can say three thousand things to them and they're only gonna do with this thing you doing like literally your behaviour is what they're really watching and I had this liberate peering in wasted no screens in the bedroom on before the panoramic and then of course their bedrooms became their classrooms and it gets so slippery and then my husband I'm like whoa okay all screens downstairs at night in my younger daughter and I was kind of managing the situation my phone was in going down because you know like I'm trying to think like I'm managing situation my younger daughter was like woman wearing you have your phone still and I'm like you're absolutely right initiatives I wasn't sleeping as well I was more stressed so then I now you know we all been down at nine and again I just reminded me and then everything kind of went back to go everything before I'm sure it's going to get slippery again with some new development but I think it's just such a reminder that they're watching which you do more than you say and then I'm whatever you want your kids are doing you have to do yourself so I mean there's so many kids I've talked to in my research on my films you know they'll tell my parents are on their phones all the time .
(74:17.07, 74:35.64) (spk ??): you know I need to somebody who's done parenting and written parenting books for the last twenty years I've I phoned in on that freeze as well which is do as I say not as I do isn't really a good strategy in any aspect of parents think doesn't know what to talk about technology your bed time or you know which email king or whatever I mean or anything yes .
(74:36.45, 75:11.02) (spk 0): exactly so you know I do want to point out there obviously all of these expensive laptop interesting resources and things in you can look them up I also do want to point out that a lot of parties gone into it to me we've got reflect the American can be P. address you have guidelines set aside by age for me to use the World Health Organization so it's a good thing has to know that those resources are there till half time they find in the sort of information overload your age we're knowing where to look is is really helpful okay I got another question is do you think my I am ten because I wanna let everybody gets final spotting year .
(75:11.83, 75:14.54) (spk 0): and you look at it you myself this time so that's good .
(75:15.35, 75:36.95) (spk 0): questions that you may be for Adam and a little bit and everybody's trying to put together their final stops so that we can get the million we're do schools fitting in with us again picking up on that team females we've got the balance of stuff technology use really exploding with the pen down Megan schools really fit in with others may see Adam on you did already sending don't Adam annals with you can follow .
(75:39.44, 75:45.37) (spk 1): you know I would say it's a good question %HESITATION much sure you know where to school stating %HESITATION .
(75:46.22, 76:17.1) (spk 1): it's a big puddle and schools are giving our kids as someone said earlier %HESITATION for you know four years old I pad so again it's not just our decision as parents it's complicated enough for us managing or home that you bring the school to the whole during a pandemic for even I would private to send something similar even last year or two years ago and you know because again depending on the schools for the very general terms now sorry there garbage trucks outside a but the %HESITATION .
(76:18.14, 76:18.62) (spk 1): Dan .
(76:19.43, 76:45.47) (spk 1): the bottom line is that if it gets even more complicated so we're the school fitting %HESITATION you have to take in their information and again adjust your balance again balance not being you know a goal there okay now we're going to give balance but we're adjusting we're we're taking in this more information and we're we're finding a way to go to chronically constantly I just enjoy and .
(76:47.11, 76:47.4) (spk 1): but .
(76:48.85, 76:49.81) (spk 1): we're resilient .
(76:50.65, 77:24.54) (spk 1): teaching our kids to regulate also June to develop correct be able to push the room quite a bit of hardship that we all have been living through so it's not it's a my my summary is school complicated tremendously and it's it's still your decision as parents in our give you back to the school and I would try to understand what are the policies do they have any principle control software is there anything that's already built in a specially when the school is the one dictating what our children being exposed to .
(77:26.56, 77:30.72) (spk ??): my turn yes that's right okay I'm I'm on the side of you on my freedom .
(77:31.67, 77:33.02) (spk 1): thank you I'll take it from here .
(77:33.83, 77:34.12) (spk 1): so .
(77:35.43, 77:35.83) (spk 1): great to .
(77:36.64, 77:52.37) (spk 1): so really well I would just like to say is that we need to have a holistic approach right we need everybody doing this everybody has to pitch in in parent as additional parenting community with at the schools schools have to have their acceptable use policies that's with me with my legal had on .
(77:53.18, 78:56.01) (spk 1): we have to inform the parents how to use the devices that they're sending home with the kids and I know that it's a horrible layer to add on internet safety tips and digital citizenship when you just want to teach a history class but I think if we're going to send home those tablets then we have to also send home the instructions of how to use them I get parents all the time so we're not quite sure if the webcam should be on a Mike should be on those things %HESITATION schools should be made out just as we teaching our children we have a pen and we say what do you say it's the same thing when we turn on a webcam and we go into the system we came in with the new data xterra so there's a certain amount netiquette that needs to be shared but I'm not going to put the blame on anybody because I know the pending because put it on into the situation but again I would just dress you know don't panic parent good together top with each other top with the teachers and figure this out because we really only have one chance at this social experiment the digital pairing years is is is Adam said and we've we've got to you know get the wagons going .
(78:56.82, 79:7.32) (spk 0): you know I am I mean this year quick fire questions and then I'm going to traffic each of you to give some final facts and one leave enough time that you don't get like ten seconds for a final fight .
(79:8.28, 79:32.25) (spk 0): but I'm gonna say you know I've given a couple ten times and I must be very much of the belief that asking questions and gauging people is much more interesting than just making a statement and so I started my first ten pop up with a question and it was what it despite the after the intentions despite a hard business savvy data driven technology inform know how and all the information you just provided our finger tips we are nevertheless raising our children to succeed in a world that no wonder exist .
(79:33.06, 79:59.99) (spk ??): and I think all of you have really sort of broad down home insurance all these ways of this isn't just technology this is the world our kids will live again and it's our job to help connecting and help prepare them to succeed in that world which ten rooms you know first point which is if not to what we grew up in I know how much grew up in that world the same to send our children are so with dad as sort of a leading to the final started why don't we go we'll start with Adam and then we'll go I'm gonna give you the order see if you know .
- end of chunk 8-
(80:00.0, 80:11.58) (spk ??): on an economic you but we'll go with Adam and then him and then I'll lose I'm so really I'm always a bit pen TD and Tiffany so Adam Europe for closing fast like to look around the Brady bunch .
(80:13.43, 80:21.27) (spk ??): I guess that would make you Alice sure anyway so we're the first generation of sideboards that's what I'm gonna close with .
(80:22.08, 80:36.92) (spk 2): R. as that sounds %HESITATION we all are as adults we rely on our technology to help this function especially during the pandemic it's been a lifesaver almost probably literally I'm well to work we're able to reach all of you technology is amazing .
(80:37.79, 80:44.77) (spk 2): and it comes with the tremendous concerns an impact as we've been discussing which is why everyone is short today .
(80:45.58, 80:55.33) (spk ??): %HESITATION so %HESITATION I introduce the parenting approach what I recommend to live in the side work world because sorry kids no no differently grew up in this .
(80:56.2, 81:4.14) (spk 2): is to be very clear that the access that you as the parent or handing your child and whatever young age but it will be a young age .
(81:5.07, 81:52.37) (spk 2): that there is based on what they are able to demonstrate an each child with their strengths and weaknesses and vulnerabilities will then show you what they are able able to handle and wear again symptoms come through on being over stimulated being having a difficult time settling down being aggressive again %HESITATION in in then basically the next level of access on what they're able to demonstrate and show not just what they say and if you if you set up in that way that the plan should be that they are moving towards their development getting more more access as they're able to handle it and it's feeling relatively more comfortable to not gonna feel comfortable because parenting is a very difficult seven tasks .
(81:53.18, 82:0.94) (spk ??): right well thank you Adam okay I was a bit you're ready thank you yes I am I always look forward to seeing when I go out to Adam so I'm just going to say .

(82:26.05, 82:43.48) (spk 0): sure I can go ahead and go give so my closing potter really this needs to be an ongoing dialogue with our children and we need to bring that wait until something bad happens so for instance one of the things that we do with our daughter is we do too high and low every day .
(82:44.29, 82:50.61) (spk 0): A. N. yesterday she told us you know my best friend told me that her mom said that I wasn't doing a very good friend .
(82:52.35, 83:22.22) (spk 0): yeah and that's something that one of come up if I hadn't asked him he hadn't normalised having those homes to conversations everyday and I think it's parents that's one of the things that we need to be aware of this we need to be asking the questions everyday insuring that we're there to listen for the small stuff because if we are willing to talk about the small stuff they're not willing to come to us about the big stuff and so press control applications or night keep talking to your kids .
(83:24.24, 83:26.03) (spk 1): thank you M. Kaylee .
(83:26.98, 84:1.83) (spk 0): yeah I second with Pam says about talking with your kids using technology with your kids %HESITATION but also as a parent reflecting on your own technology you send whether it's bringing you meaning %HESITATION yes as some of the palace said apps and this comes up a lot of my research %HESITATION team pretty good hate when their parents say one thing and do the exact opposite with their technology so reflect on how you're using technology and then for both of you your child and you speak out meaningful technology experiences %HESITATION that really align with your goals and values .
(84:3.67, 84:33.47) (spk ??): I think typically that meeting so well to you if you want to give your final map before we wrap up here yeah well this is been so wonderful I'm so glad to meet all of you in we're like crusaders of this conversation and it is in my family every six months we have this meeting which I can't see my kids look forward to but it's a text sure sure leading in literally every six months it kind of changed a little but we just return any bothered because their situation changes a .
(84:34.37, 85:14.31) (spk 0): so I think in the positive psychology framework and we're talking about like I'm already is without tech every week we are last more the kids will say well that's not like the blurred out and I just find the mood is just so much better and I pointed out okay last so much more interaction bad sorry my most creative ideas on tax reform showing them to Y. to make amazing one and even with rash I know our orders are used to save really late and I had it or there's no same same brand your brain and we've been grades and that motivated harassing every child's different is gonna be a motivated and different things but .
