what do you do if somebody ask you for any good picture.
and then finally by the time our teams are ages sixteen and seventeen we really need to release some of that parental control and give our use support as they mature into adults and let him know that you're there to help and withholding judgement very important well a little bit I said finally it's important feature teams to be good digital citizens online because I mine safety is a skill that's wired.
we shouldn't just give our teams trust would you give your sixteen year old keys of your car without teaching them how to drive no that's what we're doing with young children the ages of three and five by giving them a tablet without any kind of Scrooge control on it.
and then we need to listen and support our teams are using technology to mediate important life decisions sections their sexual relationships with their first boyfriend or girlfriend %HESITATION so we need to make time nineteen fifty apart everyday discussion of developing social emotional skills their mental health sex education.
and we want to make sure that teens feel comfortable sharing these experiences with that.
and finally we shouldn't treat online risk as more demand than typical restraint in Canada off line just because of our analysis year.
hi thank you.
Hey that was great and I have to say you know that your you touched on this idea of risk and one of the things I've done focusing on the early bring in child development room and connecting it to twenty percent we still needed throughout life one of the things I point out is that as parents we tend to try to minimise risk for our kids and I played up the irony I actually called to be able to do intelligent risk taking an idea called while skills greatly well but they don't fall down yeah can you later if I don't but not massive failure in you know when I typed in there since is it technically discussion silicon valley's unofficial marrow is fail early fail often field forward and I always have to qualify that by saying that does not mean don't use car seats it does that mean right perfect but down the middle of the highway without a break on the dance by your contact her bring with with %HESITATION jeans and letting them learn and it may be making little bit of you know some adjustments as they go along because otherwise they won't be able to deal against give back to the very rapidly changing world we know they're gonna get exposed to it so thank you very much for that presentation.
true to our work we actually left a good bit of time here for questions and answers.
what I think we're going to do we've got a mix of questions coming you know and P. M. don't go anywhere but everybody else get ready to jump in here is we have some people who want to ask questions like we're gonna change it down and then I'm also getting some submitted that I will read but let's first check over and we're gonna go start with Caroline who's joining us today and have a question about her ten year old so surely going to Sundance feel free and ask your question and then I'll pass it to one or more of the experts depending on the questions.
okay can you hear me.
okay I need to.
my daughter was inquire to prices home with the crime scene on.
I try to remember exactly what I had worriedly.
but I'm in next.
my rising again one my phone rings.
when I called her and if there's just a big mess I can get around it.
and that's what it is these these children have so many.
between like what happened is you know different storeys that they use in it's just.
it's I can't I don't know.
you know two weeks eight.
but my phone stops working.
and she said she doesn't know she doesn't know.
I really don't believe it but I could.
so I don't even know what my husband does nothing you know jumping anything I get the essence of what you're asking for a team sort of what you'd submitted this idea of what do you do when your ten year old %HESITATION when your child can you get around it transaction fraud and would you do something to track a package PM since late last night and then maybe Adam you can have some quick fast afterwards if you'd give a straight to you in a moment landed next questions I think you very much Carolina appreciate the questions.
hi Kelly that what I loved about your question with that how can I keep up and the injury giving you is hopefully going to be a relief to you you can't there's no way you're going to keep up with the latest technology it's like trying to put a governor on your car but then there's always gonna be something other feature added that's going to add another level of risk so the way that I suggested parents to deal with this is instead of trying to stay one step ahead of your team.
instead.
have your team teaching %HESITATION so sit with your ten year old daughter and complimentary on her tech savvy ness and say Hey you know you should think about getting a degree in computer science.
in in promote that your curiosity and say could you show me how to work in how you manage your privacy settings and asking questions about it as you go because in a sense what you're doing is giving her a level of the agency and and pride in knowing.
if you choose something anything doing any more open to you as well and so maybe you don't have to feel that for T. mobile is feeling like you have to stay ahead.
grading Adam do you have some time to check on that one as well yeah I didn't read the whole question but %HESITATION I would certainly agree with everything paying just said %HESITATION you know anything a little bit mentioned something earlier about you know there is no app really for this it's really the dialogue the parent child dialogue and %HESITATION having the tenure even a ten year old savage annual take work with him every day %HESITATION you know cannot just teach you but you know even if they are gonna be holding some back because they're afraid you're gonna then take things away whatever but it's just a short series of conversations that you could have %HESITATION as as again was a bit mentioned earlier you know %HESITATION having these conversations to %HESITATION help the child know that the Ken insured really compu when they are having difficulties or they have questions like like any other parenting decision or landscape this is just more complicated and we've all said several times because we are additional parenting pioneers and we don't have a reference point here and as again Pam just said we're not going to keep up it's about you know following along and being the parents trying to respond as best weekend I'm ready to push a little bit on that because I know that there's just this one question about okay so you've got a ten year olds or whatever age child and they're sort of testing your limits right and then when you when you do have those conversations it's not just a matter of all pretext everybody thinks I don't know like I don't know how that happened when my parenting strategy around the text what would you say to that and then we'll jump in I'm gonna give the other payments so we'll head up we're gonna go into an interesting question about related specifically to know diversity and how it relates to sort items items on an end out each year thanks but it Adam first if you want to address the okay well I'm not I don't know so I see this is a joke I try to be the same time not the most sink so.
basically when I would go back to is a setting up some sort of system where the child's access is contingent not in a really formal really straight away but is continuing if then when then on what they're able to demonstrate what what is the behaviour that they're showing not just what they set those kids are really good at saying the right thing I do that later can I do this if I get you know when you do this then you get that in polling the access back as a motivator for them to either be more honest or it's okay to take a break whether it should buy or not it's it's good it's good to take a break and then reset.
really well see you for that and like I said we're gonna make a bit of a shift here to a topic also consequence retirement Lee I am fact invites and some research is going on related to kids who are on the autism spectrum disorder or happy H. D. and their you know in other forms of moral diversity in their technology use and what what would you say to variations on that so if anybody wants to jump in this an extra up I. C. P. M. first to take off a museum in a package with him but if someone else wants to chime in outrage your feet P. M. sure yeah I mean this public is actually very near and dear to my heart my husband is a high functioning autism on the spectrum and we're we're in the process of getting our our data value waited and I've done some initial research with social media use of people on the autism spectrum and some of the things that I can say.
are they.
there's benefits technology is for people on the spectrum.
because it gives them the ability to navigate some of the social skills in communications in more mediated environment that being said the social norms of technology sometimes tricky for the for these individuals to navigate so for instance when you're on Facebook in your friends.
sometimes that speaking literally as well this person is my friend or this person is available online to check so why I think messaging me back another issue that comes up quite frequently when it comes to near diversity.
and young.
Dan is the topic of pornography.
I'll just have to be honest with you however fears so much easier than having intimate relationship with the nother human being and so sometimes it might take the place of that and so while some exploration into pornography and sexual exploration for fourteenth older teens is appropriate having these discussions early on and with our children who are on the spectrum to let him know that Hey you know you need to understand that what you see in personality is it why is typical in any in a normal and healthy relationship between two people and then also.
dealing with some of the issues around addictive patterns and behaviours X..
I think your annual Lara.
we look at the moderator to have to be told on your so I seen thank you very much for that entering and it's nice because we're getting a lot of questions you know I'm trying to kind of put several to gather but really honing in on some very specific aspects and clearly people want to know what to do with all this great information I'm gonna let whoever wants to jump in on this one address the idea how to monitor gaming specifically the issue of gaming in which you do or not do in regards to our monitoring that do we have any takers on that one.
yea I just read my hand great only the best thing yep so.
play with them.
play with them that's the first informers just because but not because I'm ringing minecraft sure %HESITATION and because of the Nintendo switch behind me but Hey with them so that way you can see and understand what they're doing in you can intervene so for example I was playing my Chris %HESITATION my past with my child actually blocking on you to the nearest minecraft video %HESITATION and their work street names that we have we're racist and so I was able to use this as a teaching moment and just say okay this is what happens to what do we do there are things that happen on roadblocks in fortnight I mean there is no game so please parents there's nothing that's safe rate but the best thing you can do is play with them so that you can show them you know how to respond if someone has a snarky comment what to do in mind perhaps somebody destroys your world empathy kindness resilience I mean a week receive these things on the time and we can show them and we we don't have to be the best I mean I'm horrible at minecraft horrible but I do play so I would say to play with them okay panel I thought they were gonna play.
you know I have to say I'll tell you I have a little bit of an addictive personality myself and never really get into this new ages of gaming.
but nothing shocked my now twenty three year old son more than you think okay show me the game and finally is healthy now yea I don't think you're going to like this one right and games whether it's gaming or watching things but that idea of sitting down knowing what you're talking about even for you know my three kids my my middle on my twenty three year old is the one who he would seek you didn't hear he really cares what I think right sort of that company of what do I think is good they had you know sort of moral compass and so when you said you know I I don't think you want to see this one and he knows I just seen him reduces use based on that alone so I love that idea.
same with big and I'm glad you mentioned just a you're you're our values because it it it's culturally religious everyone we can all do this I did some work for the ministry of communications in Qatar nine %HESITATION they don't know it's like making engine in yet I would be able to look at their pillars and online it again it's the same thing we're all looking in talking about the same thing as to be was saying you know it's Adam specifically called it should be out or not it really is it is this week all put our own values and expectations and how we use technology and you know trying to appoint from paying a plane from up all the panellists what does also bring size you can pick any specific aspect and it relates to parenting in how we approach parenting in general applied this topic seems about the rules about gaming just like you know when does the child have to be home at night depending on their age can be set some time limit or if there's chores that need to be done there can be those sort of beautiful things well %HESITATION you know if you want to jump in on that one before I move ahead and I don't know just invited really quick just you know everything that was just said which was awesome understanding the game also helps you parent the child playing the game and really brief example like for tonight if you you know you don't understand that the game but we still regional %HESITATION battle royale version of fortnight some of the parents out there nodding it's it's out of a hundred people so I'm understanding the game play is going to help you set more appropriate limits around the game itself I can go on but I'll leave it at that.
so interesting question that was raising tipping a pink I'm gonna trust this one to you what's the best process for transitioning kids you over consume media to Littleton zero during the week is there is is you have a secret for success in that transition is it ripping the I need often there you go how how would you suggest to project that yeah I think it's a light in the positioning and you know it's a lot about framing it as what brings you joy without streams and said of I'm taking away at the screen and everyone in your family has a different definition of what brings them joy that foods.
you know shop being %HESITATION reading playing music but everyone's got a different.
answer to that so what I would suggest my resume going to details with this in the book is framing it as well you wish we didn't work out what would be fun to do together and then fill the screen free day with that because then it becomes your favourite it's not a punishment but you get back and it's reminding everyone in your family including my parents and I say this because I've gotten so much bag J. S. and long walks without a phone and being present I mean I just feel like it's about rediscovering analysed analysed pleasures and everyone knows with those pleasures are you have to unfortunately these days every analysed pleasure is interrupted by attacks or notification and then you're off the thing so what is it like to be president and in doing I mean I'll go bigger picture because I don't want to live in a society that has no room for reflection or presence in the world we've created I don't wanna live in a twenty four seven world I don't want to live in a world where I'm always reacting to everyone else and this one day a week I'm not in this perpetual state of reaction to attacks to notification to the news to a phone call to the new whatever it is it's exhausting and I think after this year specially.
I think you have to have Krige to carve out a space and say I I know this is a present we value this as a family mentally you're eighteen years old we actually make the rules and I want to tell you this as a society.
one of those society they balance in words thinking and nothing came all the power in the university's raised here because that's what we've created is that.
my kids to be able to think on their own tonight not in reaction to everyone else is that and that's a really every great wisdom practise types about the value of silence the value of thinking for yourself in the value of presence and you know taking a love that I think a lot of people are telling now their heads now more than ever you know now that we've been through European down like this idea of mindfulness and self reflection in whatever form it is really being over there tell you those connexions what you also said you also brought me back to work Katie had been talking about shipping this from all just the negative two what's the matter what brings you joy whether it's using technology or not using technology what brings you joy doing it %HESITATION any type of question again and to Katie now they just involved your name can you can you share how we can support change use of media and social connecting while also setting healthy boundaries to the point of making a sort of a positive experience sure yeah no I mean I think but %HESITATION went a little bit %HESITATION.
and Tiffany actually all the panels have been saying about the importance of you know invite becoming involved yourself in what your kids are doing no matter what age so my son is four years old and.
so one room bobbed in apps like peppers paint box and pop a troll games and things like that a little bit different %HESITATION but still I find that it's much easier for me when I don't this is not me playing with him all the time but if I do spend a little bit of time really understanding the games or whatever he's doing then I get a better sense of the natural rhythm of that game or whatever application he's using and and what's a national starting point I also.
to better support he's getting out of it in house he is an individual is intractable with that particular piece of technology and I think that's really important also for parents to keep in mind is each child yes there are particular developmental stage but they all have their own quirks in their own preferences and and and for some spending thirty minutes online it's going to be very different for another child %HESITATION and so it's just really important I think it's June in.
it's much to children when you're actually participating online side and again looking out for you know when they're a little bit older are they really actively engaging or is it more of a passive experience.
she really wanted to have something that's more active are they learning skills are they going deeper into their interest one thing that we found with our research on changing the pandemic is that the change to already had interest video editing music and things like that they were using technology in ways that really felt meaningful where's the teens who generally have interest or their interest for cut off because they make %HESITATION they were kind of floundering and getting sucked into the YouTube vortex of just clicking on the next recommended video into that's really challenging I think actually I heard from them that they they wanted some support in getting back on track and and finding and connecting to meaning for technology experiences and.
times like now G. as well.
I think you made it again like what a big warning sign across my screen it just took me a minute to.
and then a precious little bit further on this idea because again you know we've got a lot of people focusing annual teens and tweens and things but we'll be back to that really %HESITATION age range in Europe you touched on it in your email sure what specific to what we've all been through we've got a question anyone else can speak to this as well %HESITATION like but you need the question is so then wondering if someone can speak about strategies for helping to support guide.
forty seven year old age range if specially in the context that these kids have been given I can buy the public schools this year mate so that now you bad twenty yes I know you already check in yes no I I'm so right now I'm in Berlin Germany and I'm very grateful that my my sons %HESITATION you tell which is similar to day care they are absolutely no technology at all so I don't have to worry about that but you said you know there are many they've been many days where we haven't been able to access daycare %HESITATION and you know it's it's really I think it's similar to how you parent without technology you it's it's the same sort of approach you have to set clear limits and then enforcing consistently and I started off as an elementary school teacher and it's the same thing.
wonderfully functioning com classroom is one where the teacher has set up very clear limits from the beginning and you just even when it's not convenience or when you're tired you still enforcing consistently and I find myself as a parent when I when I'm tired I said okay go ahead watch one more episode of public troll I pay for it later because then I'm like I'm not being consistent and as much as my son might enjoy watching one more episode of public troll and just.
I said I can enjoy more having clear guidance and knowing that their structure round him and then I'm supposed to be providing great nice features you need you want.
I mean this is the thing I heard at the beginning of parenting but I think about it so much now that my daughters are almost eighteen and twelve but you know you can say three thousand things to them and they're only gonna do with this thing you doing like literally your behaviour is what they're really watching and I had this liberate peering in wasted no screens in the bedroom on before the panoramic and then of course their bedrooms became their classrooms and it gets so slippery and then my husband I'm like whoa okay all screens downstairs at night in my younger daughter and I was kind of managing the situation my phone was in going down because you know like I'm trying to think like I'm managing situation my younger daughter was like woman wearing you have your phone still and I'm like you're absolutely right initiatives I wasn't sleeping as well I was more stressed so then I now you know we all been down at nine and again I just reminded me and then everything kind of went back to go everything before I'm sure it's going to get slippery again with some new development but I think it's just such a reminder that they're watching which you do more than you say and then I'm whatever you want your kids are doing you have to do yourself so I mean there's so many kids I've talked to in my research on my films you know they'll tell my parents are on their phones all the time.
you know I need to somebody who's done parenting and written parenting books for the last twenty years I've I phoned in on that freeze as well which is do as I say not as I do isn't really a good strategy in any aspect of parents think doesn't know what to talk about technology your bed time or you know which email king or whatever I mean or anything yes.
exactly so you know I do want to point out there obviously all of these expensive laptop interesting resources and things in you can look them up I also do want to point out that a lot of parties gone into it to me we've got reflect the American can be P. address you have guidelines set aside by age for me to use the World Health Organization so it's a good thing has to know that those resources are there till half time they find in the sort of information overload your age we're knowing where to look is is really helpful okay I got another question is do you think my I am ten because I wanna let everybody gets final spotting year.
and you look at it you myself this time so that's good.
questions that you may be for Adam and a little bit and everybody's trying to put together their final stops so that we can get the million we're do schools fitting in with us again picking up on that team females we've got the balance of stuff technology use really exploding with the pen down Megan schools really fit in with others may see Adam on you did already sending don't Adam annals with you can follow.
you know I would say it's a good question %HESITATION much sure you know where to school stating %HESITATION.
it's a big puddle and schools are giving our kids as someone said earlier %HESITATION for you know four years old I pad so again it's not just our decision as parents it's complicated enough for us managing or home that you bring the school to the whole during a pandemic for even I would private to send something similar even last year or two years ago and you know because again depending on the schools for the very general terms now sorry there garbage trucks outside a but the %HESITATION.
Dan.
the bottom line is that if it gets even more complicated so we're the school fitting %HESITATION you have to take in their information and again adjust your balance again balance not being you know a goal there okay now we're going to give balance but we're adjusting we're we're taking in this more information and we're we're finding a way to go to chronically constantly I just enjoy and.
but.
we're resilient.
teaching our kids to regulate also June to develop correct be able to push the room quite a bit of hardship that we all have been living through so it's not it's a my my summary is school complicated tremendously and it's it's still your decision as parents in our give you back to the school and I would try to understand what are the policies do they have any principle control software is there anything that's already built in a specially when the school is the one dictating what our children being exposed to.
my turn yes that's right okay I'm I'm on the side of you on my freedom.
thank you I'll take it from here.
so.
great to.
so really well I would just like to say is that we need to have a holistic approach right we need everybody doing this everybody has to pitch in in parent as additional parenting community with at the schools schools have to have their acceptable use policies that's with me with my legal had on.
we have to inform the parents how to use the devices that they're sending home with the kids and I know that it's a horrible layer to add on internet safety tips and digital citizenship when you just want to teach a history class but I think if we're going to send home those tablets then we have to also send home the instructions of how to use them I get parents all the time so we're not quite sure if the webcam should be on a Mike should be on those things %HESITATION schools should be made out just as we teaching our children we have a pen and we say what do you say it's the same thing when we turn on a webcam and we go into the system we came in with the new data xterra so there's a certain amount netiquette that needs to be shared but I'm not going to put the blame on anybody because I know the pending because put it on into the situation but again I would just dress you know don't panic parent good together top with each other top with the teachers and figure this out because we really only have one chance at this social experiment the digital pairing years is is is Adam said and we've we've got to you know get the wagons going.
you know I am I mean this year quick fire questions and then I'm going to traffic each of you to give some final facts and one leave enough time that you don't get like ten seconds for a final fight.
but I'm gonna say you know I've given a couple ten times and I must be very much of the belief that asking questions and gauging people is much more interesting than just making a statement and so I started my first ten pop up with a question and it was what it despite the after the intentions despite a hard business savvy data driven technology inform know how and all the information you just provided our finger tips we are nevertheless raising our children to succeed in a world that no wonder exist.
and I think all of you have really sort of broad down home insurance all these ways of this isn't just technology this is the world our kids will live again and it's our job to help connecting and help prepare them to succeed in that world which ten rooms you know first point which is if not to what we grew up in I know how much grew up in that world the same to send our children are so with dad as sort of a leading to the final started why don't we go we'll start with Adam and then we'll go I'm gonna give you the order see if you know.
on an economic you but we'll go with Adam and then him and then I'll lose I'm so really I'm always a bit pen TD and Tiffany so Adam Europe for closing fast like to look around the Brady bunch.
I guess that would make you Alice sure anyway so we're the first generation of sideboards that's what I'm gonna close with.
R. as that sounds %HESITATION we all are as adults we rely on our technology to help this function especially during the pandemic it's been a lifesaver almost probably literally I'm well to work we're able to reach all of you technology is amazing.
and it comes with the tremendous concerns an impact as we've been discussing which is why everyone is short today.
%HESITATION so %HESITATION I introduce the parenting approach what I recommend to live in the side work world because sorry kids no no differently grew up in this.
is to be very clear that the access that you as the parent or handing your child and whatever young age but it will be a young age.
that there is based on what they are able to demonstrate an each child with their strengths and weaknesses and vulnerabilities will then show you what they are able able to handle and wear again symptoms come through on being over stimulated being having a difficult time settling down being aggressive again %HESITATION in in then basically the next level of access on what they're able to demonstrate and show not just what they say and if you if you set up in that way that the plan should be that they are moving towards their development getting more more access as they're able to handle it and it's feeling relatively more comfortable to not gonna feel comfortable because parenting is a very difficult seven tasks.
right well thank you Adam okay I was a bit you're ready thank you yes I am I always look forward to seeing when I go out to Adam so I'm just going to say.
you're not alone digital period you are not allowed so I mean we're all here there are resources look at that find a Tiffany's book and join our digital parenting community bind Adams group on forty nine I mean there are we here you're not alone.
great thank you for that alright did I say next P. M. did they say you and Katie I think.
sure I can go ahead and go give so my closing potter really this needs to be an ongoing dialogue with our children and we need to bring that wait until something bad happens so for instance one of the things that we do with our daughter is we do too high and low every day.
A. N. yesterday she told us you know my best friend told me that her mom said that I wasn't doing a very good friend.
yeah and that's something that one of come up if I hadn't asked him he hadn't normalised having those homes to conversations everyday and I think it's parents that's one of the things that we need to be aware of this we need to be asking the questions everyday insuring that we're there to listen for the small stuff because if we are willing to talk about the small stuff they're not willing to come to us about the big stuff and so press control applications or night keep talking to your kids.
thank you M. Kaylee.
yeah I second with Pam says about talking with your kids using technology with your kids %HESITATION but also as a parent reflecting on your own technology you send whether it's bringing you meaning %HESITATION yes as some of the palace said apps and this comes up a lot of my research %HESITATION team pretty good hate when their parents say one thing and do the exact opposite with their technology so reflect on how you're using technology and then for both of you your child and you speak out meaningful technology experiences %HESITATION that really align with your goals and values.
I think typically that meeting so well to you if you want to give your final map before we wrap up here yeah well this is been so wonderful I'm so glad to meet all of you in we're like crusaders of this conversation and it is in my family every six months we have this meeting which I can't see my kids look forward to but it's a text sure sure leading in literally every six months it kind of changed a little but we just return any bothered because their situation changes a.
so I think in the positive psychology framework and we're talking about like I'm already is without tech every week we are last more the kids will say well that's not like the blurred out and I just find the mood is just so much better and I pointed out okay last so much more interaction bad sorry my most creative ideas on tax reform showing them to Y. to make amazing one and even with rash I know our orders are used to save really late and I had it or there's no same same brand your brain and we've been grades and that motivated harassing every child's different is gonna be a motivated and different things but.
showing the positive benefits of taking breaks and going off mine is really important.
great thank you so much Tiffany and you're making me remember a quote from a good friend of mine I only see the original media Tricia for those about your paediatricians but do like media but Dr Michael rich for those of you who know him back in the G. as like the Eric brief right like it's not going anywhere this is not like some a problem and be done with it or all or nothing right the point is we have to keep your phone getting polluted right one to also look into the positive aspect and how we integrated into our lives and our parenting life so all of you I think I've given some really good insights but also really practical tangible insights so I think all of you for participating in again I'm honoured to have gotten to to meet all of you and get to moderate and and with the R. I. C. P.
