(00:0.74, 00:2.23) (spk 0): no it's fine I don't .
(00:3.04, 00:3.35) (spk 0): yes .
(00:7.03, 00:7.35) (spk 0): yes .
(00:14.72, 00:15.72) (spk 0): yep so .
(00:17.33, 00:20.12) (spk 0): you know this is exactly where you should be right now .
(00:20.93, 00:32.0) (spk 0): and you know I think you know I'm glad to see what you wrote in the email about your ideas and now you know you presented this morning on the pushchair and things like that I think they're clearly .
(00:34.43, 00:35.96) (spk 0): you know I think that is .
(00:37.36, 00:45.42) (spk 0): the only like going through the methodology kind of helps you organising clarify you already radical thinking a little bit it's going to be email up .
(00:49.39, 00:51.72) (spk 0): just look at your poster right now because I saw that you .
(00:53.55, 00:54.27) (spk 0): but I think .
(00:55.18, 01:3.34) (spk 0): I think you know like in the postman when you presented there I think it was it's now much clearer how are you linking all these differences medical models yeah .
(01:4.15, 01:18.08) (spk 0): do they choose to count design of the intervention let's say and what you need to do %HESITATION yeah let you know all these things that go to the feedback you've got friends if I find the feedback on you know .
(01:19.06, 01:23.29) (spk 0): what exam only is mediation yes .
(01:25.12, 01:38.03) (spk 0): so I think by when we were in the session this morning what was good I think and that could be productive it's just seems like a preliminary be likely more bottom up kind of thing yeah .
(01:39.22, 01:42.67) (spk 0): I know we've been talking a lot about the intervention with the invention consists a .
(01:44.21, 01:50.91) (spk 0): I think your observation of that being quite top down and just you know here's a material having to use it it's not really .
(01:51.72, 01:55.6) (spk 0): however let you know is very absolutely .
(01:56.69, 01:57.5) (spk 0): in some ways .
(01:58.33, 01:58.67) (spk 0): and .
(02:0.48, 02:13.57) (spk 0): I think in terms of the regions of your research on what you're trying to do might actually be very good to have some courses in aspect where you you know broken trust rather than doing interviews .
(02:14.39, 02:14.83) (spk 0): yep .
(02:16.24, 02:44.04) (spk 0): it's saying okay you know what kind of intervention would help you or what do you what would you think you know would be you know poses on let's see you know the kind of previous stuff you can take the problem because it's really hard for people who don't do this nothing is working designed something from scratch right but you can take the family media plan and do like a critical you know like walk through what do you think about this how would you do that .
(02:45.22, 02:59.7) (spk 0): you know %HESITATION well I do have you have you done something else you can maybe you can get some parents you actually try to engage with it and some who haven't or I've done other times since family intervention might be a bit of a search to find the people that you know .
(03:1.16, 03:5.96) (spk 0): yeah I think that's that's promising because it gives it a more definite might be able to .
(03:7.45, 03:43.98) (spk 0): help you with those questions that you're asking right now you know because I think they are if you take that open approach you're either so you have to go through marks that you've been using thank you know you could do that in approach where you incorporate all these different ones instead of when you go straight like Australia the intervention pop down you're kind of pre determining at another day you should still do that I think because this is clearly what's going on but alright well you know what the practise is at the moment but yeah I don't know what if you like tell me a little bit I'm rambling a little bit but it's also I think it's really cool .
(03:55.93, 03:56.36) (spk 0): let me .
(04:3.96, 04:4.85) (spk 0): you should be able to sell .
(05:3.49, 05:34.51) (spk 0): I mean everything about C. pounding literacy skills ready it's always there's a component of skill to it and is a component of knowledge to it right %HESITATION all these kind of things like what do you know what can you do yeah and when what do you do is your perceptions and behaviours yes so we think of it in there kind of you know whatever digital literacy model did you know literally the combination of these things out right we have skills and knowledge what kind what do you know what can you do then we have .
(05:36.25, 05:48.75) (spk 0): behaviour is in town motivation you have the motivation is always a bit weird because it's like before and after but let's put in there which is like you know the kind of one do you do and what do you think .
(05:50.06, 05:58.8) (spk 0): and then the middle help is the outcome right so if you think about the kind of you know we don't get the three levels of digital engagement or disengagement yeah .
(05:59.64, 06:17.01) (spk 0): this is engagement with technologies within a family setting but that's the kind of idea right if you think about this receive dental thing how do you know what you can do what you do what you do saying leave this certain outcomes indigenous societies thank in digital yep .
(06:17.94, 06:21.29) (spk 0): so that is hoping its digital literacy yeah .
(06:26.65, 06:31.95) (spk 0): yep yep thanks a literacy digit patch digital parenting literacy .
(06:39.56, 06:39.9) (spk 0): yep .
(06:49.3, 07:0.99) (spk 0): so what this is why I use the terminology social digital for everything that I do so there is you know if you have to rental knowledge you will have rental knowledge around or anything yeah .
(07:2.36, 07:16.36) (spk 0): Randall parenting skills yes what do you know how to do with you know and then you will have a digital component as well yes so you will have its parents my normal parent but they might not know how to do that in the digit all kind of go around technologies right .
(07:17.73, 07:35.63) (spk 0): yep so I think that there's a double and a same thing with behaviours and perceptions is about kind of you know what do you do %HESITATION what do you do with the joy you can sink if there's like a specially in the perceptions because I must be present maybe perceptions about counting in and kind of the right kind of thing to do .
(07:36.81, 07:40.94) (spk 0): I have a general sense of the might be Startin instead are you know .
- end of chunk 1-
(10:1.29, 10:5.01) (spk 2): yes they are specifically around the digital space .
(10:12.01, 10:12.87) (spk 2): read all the details .
(11:11.49, 11:11.71) (spk 2): yes .
(11:22.82, 11:23.06) (spk 2): yep .
(11:25.84, 11:39.12) (spk 2): yep no I think so too I think so and I think you know then then we come back to a lot of these kind of course the reason behaviour change there is a plan behaviour enough reason actually you know I know and the cricket struggle against does .
(11:40.76, 12:8.62) (spk 2): more a social critical perspective so I think there is no that's that's the you know there's a lot of links that you can make between those and can broaden your brother that's in digital engagement literature or engagement with technology to address and that is not reflected at all in the parenting you know everything about parental mediation because things are not taking up actual is about defining parental mediation island you know looking at child behaviour but not really at the parents .
(12:9.43, 12:55.39) (spk 2): helicase abilities or the parents in between here right like what is that you know the translation of knowledge and skills in to be a year fifteen double behavioural patterns is not well there is a big literature upside you know she was trying to use a baby changing you know natural behaviour you know there's people been thinking about this all the time but it's not integrated in also I think that's where your original contribution is in this field you know right really so I think you know that's something that's been you know like all this convolution August thinking about all these theories and also meant you know that's what you have to do to be able to end up in this kind of position that you're in right now I think this is you know .
(12:56.43, 13:13.27) (spk 2): is this also Canada model is kind of you know need yep you will you also have to do a project that is you know there's a try to do everything as we receiving sessions morning right you need to do you need to find this core and do with is for .
(13:14.61, 13:18.57) (spk 2): your real competition so good thing great and .
(13:25.13, 13:27.17) (spk 2): could you give me a little bit because it's over .
(13:34.64, 13:34.95) (spk 2): yep .
(13:51.68, 13:53.11) (spk 2): values are .
(13:54.38, 14:5.63) (spk 2): so I think they've already invested in English is like valuables valued appreciated more something that you do in object this started because that is fine it's like a good word but .
(14:07.9, 14:11.85) (spk 2): yep constructive in values or valuable you know .
(14:32.59, 14:57.39) (spk 2): that's really interesting okay maybe maybe it's a language that could be using the thing is that when we use it in this contact obviously with you appreciation as you appreciate something like an object an external thing rather than you know I appreciate that you did that for me is not about a conversation or but it might be interesting to see that the children maybe that terminology that you would have to do some explaining within this contact of what it means but might be .
(15:32.27, 15:32.59) (spk 2): yep .
(15:44.67, 15:46.06) (spk 2): I could send that to prevent .
(15:47.47, 15:59.88) (spk 2): right worried if you like %HESITATION but you wanted to be on credit watch cartoons all the time or legal on the road all the time like everything they make sure you talk to them about what they're doing and why you know why don't .
(16:1.14, 16:1.78) (spk 2): where's it by .
(16:2.82, 16:3.07) (spk 2): thank you .
(16:11.66, 16:12.01) (spk 2): yes .
(16:15.05, 16:17.62) (spk 2): I know that's why I think it might be done in the region .
(16:48.34, 16:48.62) (spk 2): okay .
(16:59.47, 17:5.35) (spk 2): yes yes yes yeah like generational transfer a you know like continuity you know .
(17:6.16, 17:9.66) (spk 2): B. twenty five inheritance yes the morning how .
(17:29.68, 17:31.7) (spk 2): the school and make their homework and .
(17:43.68, 17:43.96) (spk 2): yes .
(18:11.07, 18:11.43) (spk 2): yep .
(18:27.69, 18:47.06) (spk 2): yeah I mean so this is a bit against this is the way I need to find literacy you know I think it was a C. is from from skills and knowledge to outcomes right everything about everything just go stand by because project if that whole process right that is the Tricity for me the individual elements are skills or here's you know .
(18:48.71, 19:4.51) (spk 2): but in the end when we talk about literally the whole thing about being able to find in use information to fly a June Jennifer you know take action do achieving certain outcomes in this in your case mental help so I would say that literacy is actually branche .
(19:6.57, 19:16.27) (spk 2): these things you know these other things our our account stuff need to receive their skills or or elements to that bigger literacy idea .
(19:17.32, 19:21.13) (spk 2): how are you I mean I know everybody agrees with me in this but .
(19:21.94, 19:22.35) (spk 2): yep .
(19:37.89, 19:38.17) (spk 2): yes .
- end of chunk 2-
(20:4.99, 20:24.74) (spk 1): yeah no I think that's that's the whole I think dad's yes I do that's all promising and and good and that's why that's why you're doing this project because this you know just where it goes from series all these academics doing theory too expensive doing practise family in family right .
(20:25.68, 20:40.96) (spk 1): really so I think this is also why when you were talking about the bottom box kind of approach I think this is that's also very promising in that sense yeah but you can you can also see okay so this was a theory sent about all these parenting options in parenting styles and .
(20:41.77, 20:47.91) (spk 1): you know I have believed to do well being but you know translated into certain interventions .
(20:48.72, 20:52.55) (spk 1): my experience this is found you know from the bottom up with family .
(20:53.54, 21:20.09) (spk ??): so much about the problems they're having but about like so I think that's the that's the original part you can contribute not so much in terms of the problems that they're having with parenting because there's you know Sonya and everybody else is already done quite a lot of interviews but that but more about okay you know if you want to change something or if you want to improve you know like what are the concrete steps that you think would be most helpful .
(21:21.32, 21:33.55) (spk 1): if they tell you talk more yes I what kind of %HESITATION proof things would you like to sizes or you know information would you would you want to have they've been like you know .
(21:34.43, 21:36.92) (spk 1): conversation about this or talk to your child .
(21:39.52, 21:42.31) (spk 1): because in the end that behaviour change I have a change .
(21:44.03, 21:44.99) (spk 1): so yep .
(21:46.04, 21:51.36) (spk 1): and then you might see that there's four people much more problems we could be seen as handy Joel and broad .
(21:52.68, 22:7.69) (spk 1): they don't see small behaviour this is often a problem of behaviour change you know please talk about anything I don't want to change behaviour that they think it's negative or next week something that life is a bit off think of it as a big behaviour right now great right if you do exchanging .
(22:8.59, 22:9.07) (spk 1): like .
(22:10.58, 22:17.93) (spk 1): addiction or something right like I need to be not addictive right alright I want to I want to become vegetarian .
(22:18.74, 22:55.07) (spk 1): I'm interested in and then people say oh my god like you know the called party approach refresh some people but not many so you could say that okay if you want to start become vegetarian then maybe start by eating one you know I've been one day a week you don't eat me or you know something like that and I think that like breaking it down into smaller chunks for for this kind of parenting stuff it's going to be very importance and that's something that you can do with families yes so you could you could really think about you know that kind of quality pre .
(22:55.88, 22:58.7) (spk 1): do you know G. methodology yes .
(22:59.58, 23:2.93) (spk 1): so I think that is very very promising and .
(23:4.81, 23:12.17) (spk 1): something that you will need to do also to be able to understand how you have to divide design your experiment in your intervention .
(23:14.72, 23:15.11) (spk 1): yes .
(23:41.52, 23:41.89) (spk 1): no .
(24:3.68, 24:4.02) (spk 1): yep .
(25:11.29, 25:11.76) (spk 1): okay .
(26:26.5, 26:26.93) (spk 1): okay .
(26:32.78, 26:33.12) (spk 0): okay .
(26:34.1, 26:44.59) (spk 0): so I think I think you know there's like you can also think about it in terms of several barriers you know where my Beria's occur for people to start you know using technology in a way .
(26:46.01, 27:6.81) (spk ??): that is kind of more positive in terms of mental help and all about being in the family right okay I also like how this one is at the end keeps changing and every everything that I see like well being family well being child well being health anyway I think this is a bit you need to have a separate session on that last column that we keep ignoring .
(27:8.91, 27:16.44) (spk ??): thank you say that you know before your parental knowledge there is like a space right would certainly happen in certain you know certain kind of .
(27:17.25, 27:18.36) (spk 0): patterns of behaviour .
(27:19.39, 27:36.33) (spk ??): and then %HESITATION you know from from those parents to to mental health they'll remind you know they're the first will need to be a desire for change right that's nice you recognise that you need to change I think awful so let's assume that everybody is going to be part of this has a desire for change .
(27:38.43, 27:39.25) (spk 0): then %HESITATION .
(27:40.81, 28:9.91) (spk ??): then the barriers could be in the fact that people don't have the noise or unable to acquire this kind of nice yes or the night is not sufficient in the sense of like that's where you manipulate the depths of knowledge process so that might be one Beria but actually there might be another barrier is translating that knowledge into actual you know behaviours and perceptions so they might be able to perceptions problems yes .
(28:10.72, 28:25.03) (spk ??): so and then you know kind of the last fundamental Beria is the translation of behaviours and perceptions into actual changes in or you know family house members need to help children to help .
(28:26.68, 28:27.71) (spk 0): remember my top .
(28:29.39, 28:29.92) (spk 1): so .
(28:30.84, 28:34.3) (spk 0): so I think you know on all these stages that can go wrong right .
(28:35.63, 28:41.64) (spk 0): yep and so I think that's the thing you know events because most interventions focus only on knowledge .
(28:42.45, 28:57.14) (spk ??): or only in providing like behaviour guidelines but no kind of checking on whether plans are actually you know doing that yeah which is not the same as knowledge rate ninety guidelines for behaviour that seems nice because nine .
- end of chunk 3-
(30:00.0, 30:1.24) (spk 1): he's only standing Y. .
(30:3.01, 30:4.97) (spk 1): right mind or do this yes .
(30:06.3, 30:16.56) (spk 1): and then you know like %HESITATION and there's very few who actually almost man well actually focus on changes in or anything prove mints in mental health or you know .
(30:17.47, 30:25.94) (spk 1): I just don't think on this file I think this is this is exactly where you're supposed to be in your policy even now for this such a massive John .
(30:26.75, 30:51.63) (spk 1): you know from the beginning of the like yeah I mean I need to roll that is able to strip you know background you know the beginning of March at the beginning %HESITATION %HESITATION lanterns rationally but like you know like to where you are now this I can I can really see that this is like a project and you can you know you could this is in better shape and some of the other methodological things that I've seen that people are going into their you know .
(30:52.73, 30:55.21) (spk 1): well it depends so they're great .
(30:56.14, 31:34.51) (spk 1): interview with so I think this is fine in case you have any doubt this is our continue working on this next year to improve it but this is really like I can see the links to you are you nearly you know they might be a little bit I need to be done in terms of cleaning up the language and clarifying the language in the theory making the argument clear rather than the summary all those things that we talked about before you can see how their knowledge that you build up in the literature is now going into this %HESITATION so I think when we think about what you what you might do now is really start writing this out as a methodological chapter .
(31:35.79, 31:36.09) (spk 1): yes .
(31:37.88, 31:56.38) (spk 1): you know I mean the methodological changes you make references back to literature right so in this time of the operation Ising this and things like that so I think that that is going to be the best way forward now and then after that you know actually break we can come back to you Dearie but I think now like really think about .
(31:57.43, 32:9.28) (spk 1): nearly when you're working on the methodology chapter you're gonna get ideas for the theory as you were just saying that so you've got the note saying if you're even doing try to start complete I like to have you know that's actually time and you know .
(32:11.75, 32:20.87) (spk 1): but but I think now it's important that you write this down and you make the links to the literature in the methodological chapters form yes .
(32:21.68, 32:22.04) (spk 1): no .
(32:23.59, 32:24.73) (spk 1): well you know .
(32:25.95, 32:31.05) (spk 1): followed remember exactly you have twelve thousand words right ten thousand twelve thousand words .
(32:33.81, 32:34.31) (spk 1): or it's .
(32:35.62, 32:40.94) (spk 1): so you know you think about the business to be done and and things like you know .
(32:42.11, 32:52.71) (spk 1): read thousand four thousand two hundred three thousand four thousand fifty or you just need to be treated on four thousand might be a little bit shorter than the theory in this case in all cases but .
(32:53.65, 32:58.72) (spk 1): you know introduction conclusion section but I think the next thing for you to really write that nothing on to check their .
(32:59.88, 33:2.07) (spk 1): when is the deadline again for them .
(33:4.54, 33:5.93) (spk 1): for these yes .
(33:08.6, 33:15.87) (spk 1): right yep okay so yep that's really what you need to do now I think that's I don't know do you have any kind of concerns or .
(33:16.99, 33:18.33) (spk 1): or worried .
(33:55.85, 33:56.04) (spk 1): yes .
(33:58.29, 34:04.9) (spk 1): what I would like I think hi you know what we would like to see in something like this just in general for this kind of document .
(34:6.38, 34:45.88) (spk 1): an engagement with the methodology chapter with the research centre asking down on which kind of a little bit of a kind of an overview of what kind of methodology has been used in this kind of you know that like parenting and literature and what has people done yes so that's it it's going to be already with the methodology right and and maybe if there's a split between people who work on the family media plan or like psychology is working on interventions or something and all the parental uses car for a media communications right I'm very very different and so they use different methodologies is different paradise with different personalities so in that sense yes a little bit of a discussion of more strength Roger .
(34:46.69, 34:57.86) (spk 1): and I'm not a logical concepts that you are engaging with but that is not the focus of this chapter in the end of the focus of this jacket is how bad through G. granddad look at what has been done .
(34:58.67, 35:02.6) (spk 1): and how what you're trying to do in terms of your research question then translated into .
(35:3.77, 35:12.83) (spk 1): no specific of the research project basically when we were going to review this is we're gonna say okay you are ready to start working on your field but next year .
(35:14.1, 35:31.92) (spk 1): yeah that's good that's the point of the upgrade document that we have the confidence that there's a project there that it's feasible that you will be able to do it without us having to hold your hand all the time you know that you have cutting both if you had a problem with the largest branding to be able to take this project for a completed .
(35:33.03, 35:33.66) (spk 1): so .
(35:34.61, 35:56.62) (spk 1): that's the point of this so what we need to see here is that we can see that you five through that there's going to be changes there's going to have to be adjustments but we know what the building blocks are on which you are going to go forward and you'll give us another detail to see that this is not just you know I want to research for us for mediation and well being yeah like it okay thank you very much .
(35:57.65, 36:12.5) (spk 1): exactly anything else we could do that right so little bit theory about I said I'll G. to position the field and the kind of a promotion on policies in the field but you don't have to use all that kind of complicated language for that you can .
(36:13.6, 36:33.03) (spk 1): really about how are you position yourself to logically which kind of instruments in pools and paradigms are you using from a previous research you know thank you because using family media plan something somewhere and you know but you also adding like a lot of the present mediation that Richard has a very different you know .
(36:34.3, 36:36.67) (spk 1): progress the company .
(36:37.91, 36:38.35) (spk 1): so you have .
(36:39.41, 36:45.81) (spk 1): right I think it doesn't specify in the guidelines these guidelines change every year I should know this thank .
(36:57.68, 36:58.43) (spk 1): how strange .

(42:10.82, 42:38.77) (spk 1): no we did in the end %HESITATION do the medical department yep and then just be running ball you know going you had to go I decided to modelling %HESITATION when happens when you know were excellent when there's big model stress events right you know I'm not talking to them about the actual content really just kind of modelling different types of stressors and you know when there's a plan and bronzes aren't mine and data you know you can do all this year I got money that you want but if you're building it on .
(42:39.58, 42:48.24) (spk 1): you know what kind of great small these like once in a lifetime event there's not a lot of data is directly opposite happens to my network or .

(42:58.32, 43:1.71) (spk 1): the right place to be but I think in your case you're not allowed to just .
(43:2.52, 43:04.9) (spk 1): talk to anybody so this point .
(43:11.0, 43:11.33) (spk 1): yep .
(43:17.13, 43:17.49) (spk 1): yep .
(43:54.51, 44:4.11) (spk 1): I think that's that's why it's good to try it out you know with what you've got so far and then try out as a kind of you know over the next four weeks five weeks four weeks I guess .
(44:05.6, 44:19.87) (spk 1): goodbye two to try this out to start getting you know like that kind of real thanks to my mother's data already with all this kind of theoretical aspects speculation actually working yes I think it's great .
(44:37.31, 44:51.83) (spk 1): no I think it would you would you go if you're talking about how you're going to talk to people about you know inviting them no I think you can you can see like you live really like to talk about you know kind of you know .
(44:52.7, 45:11.27) (spk 1): the way that people parent around digital technologies and you know kind of policy families involved I'm involved in that and you know their concerns or their hopes you know on how they might be able to manage these things you know I think that that is it's a much more about you know you don't have to say like .
(45:12.08, 45:18.66) (spk 1): do you want to change your behaviour or something like that but it's much more about these practises and bring that in .
(45:27.19, 46:23.89) (spk 1): yeah that's that's what ended quality affordable come up right yes so you know so you will you can talk to people about you know like you can invite people to come talk about their parenting practises and if they you know like especially interested in there some people want to change something or feel that you know they can usually help in you know usually I could use some help in in in how they manage median household and then those people you talk about that and then obviously you don't you can ask them directly about what is it that stops you from doing these things but it's more about you know like what would be useful you need more information as to what kind of information here is a bunch of things that our information is this would you mean are there something missing or is there something I'm clear in here is seen even planned I've intervention you know I mean you planning your case and this useful or as you know it's it's not what you need is is not like you know in which way why is it not like would you be able to do this you know what do you what do you have information out .
(46:25.04, 46:29.84) (spk 1): what might be the Beria's you can ask him what maybe the obstacles for you to actually implement this you know .
(46:30.95, 46:46.91) (spk 1): ninety three so that's the way but I think the invitation and they kind of you know description I've wanted since about it got over publication about parenting practises how people want to change those are approved those they make no sense to trouble people think that doing everything I'm making it because they're not gonna be the one .
(46:48.52, 46:57.05) (spk 1): you know thank you want to actually get a chance I'll get a chance going to situation in which the government is going to say everybody has to do .
(46:58.86, 47:0.17) (spk 1): rentals you know .
(47:1.44, 47:4.08) (spk 1): literacy classes around this .
(47:6.14, 47:11.11) (spk 1): and I think that's gonna happen and nothing in the liberal society like Britain but .
(47:23.79, 48:12.81) (spk 1): so I'm going into relationships families and then you know like she can definitely help you I mean you know this is this is the best every individual project you're gonna have to find you know for the for the initial stages this is going to be probably people that you know once removed or you know like you don't have to streamline but then you're gonna have to think about because you want to provide the families right so where are these people okay good how are you contact them so what we will do after thank you good I don't write that into your message I'll probably good how are you thinking of recruiting people where are you going to get them what is the kind of diversity thank you are interested in or your experiment you know because you've limited diversity is not going to be in terms of any kind of parent yeah because you what you gonna have to focus on parents who actually would .
(48:13.62, 48:18.85) (spk 1): or to the importance of change or I CD ten a need to engage with this .
(48:20.3, 48:22.09) (spk 1): because otherwise it's a different project .
(48:23.23, 48:23.5) (spk 1): yes .

(49:0.45, 49:2.02) (spk 1): where are you going to find your .
(49:4.34, 49:4.69) (spk 1): it's .
(49:9.82, 49:26.35) (spk 1): and this is going to be important just a programme to discussions you having in the five hundred in terms of how you define family right because they want to know where you gonna get your family you have to understand how the locations where you might be finding your family is not gonna be normative towards for cancel this family .
